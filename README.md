In order to run the web-application, if it is the first time, you need to install `gatsby-cli`:

```sh
# only once on first time
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

and run from the `gatsby_site` folder as follows:

```sh
cd gatsby_site
npm install
gatsby develop
```

This will run Gatsby site on port `8000`. You will see the demo looks something like the following:
