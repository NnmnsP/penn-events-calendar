All events happening at Penn in an easy-to-use UI. 
Recommendation 

## Run web server locally

First, make sure that you have `backend/requirements.txt` and `npm` installed. 
Then, you can run the 

```sh
cd fronend/
npm install
npm start
```

This will run python `flask` backend and `react` frontend on port 3000.
