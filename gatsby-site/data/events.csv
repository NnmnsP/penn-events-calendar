"Tuesday, April 30, 2019 - 11:30am","Cold Spring Harbor LaboratoryDiscovering dynamic states of neural populationsNeural responses and behavior are influenced by internal brain states, such as arousal or task context. Ongoing variations of these internal states affect global patterns of neural activity, giving rise to apparent variability of neural responses under the same experimental conditions. Uncovering dynamics of internal states from data proved difficult with traditional techniques based on trial-averaged responses of single neurons. In this talk, I will describe our recent work leveraging multi-electrode neural activity recordings and computational models to reveal internal-state dynamics of neural populations during perception and goal-directed behavior. I will show how endogenous fluctuations of ensemble neural activity in the primate visual cortex depend on the global arousal and selective attention. The spatiotemporal structure of these fluctuations accounts for correlated variability across cortical layers and columns. I will then present a broadly applicable, non-parametric framework for discovering neural population dynamics directly from the data without a priori model assumptions. The framework uncovers dynamic computations from large-scale neural recordings with single-neuron, single-spike resolution.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Tatiana Engel,11:30 AM,,Discovering dynamic states of neural populations,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-tatiana-engel,30-04-2019
"Tuesday, April 16, 2019 - 11:30am","Institute of NeuroscienceNational Yang-Ming UniversityProbability estimation and its neurocomputational substratesMany decisions we make depend on how we evaluate potential outcomes and estimate their probabilities of occurrence. Outcome valuation is subjective – it requires consulting the decision maker’s internal preferences and is sensitive to context. Probability estimation is also subjective – but requires the decision maker to first extract statistics from the environment before using them to estimate probability. Currently, it is unclear whether the two computations share similar algorithms and neural-algorithmic implementations.I will present our recent work on context-dependent probability estimation, which we identified both similarities and differences in computational mechanisms between valuation and probability estimation. I will also talk about work on modeling probability estimation as Bayesian inference, which focuses on examining how and how well people estimate probability of reward in the presence of prior and likelihood information. Here we found suboptimal performance similar to base-rate neglect, which surprisingly is robust across a wide variety of setups that try to eliminate this behavior. Together, these results suggest many interesting aspects of probability estimation that have yet to be fully understood at the behavioral, computational, and neural algorithmic levels.Bio: I obtained my PhD (2008) from New York University working on representations and use of probability information in decision making under risk with Larry Maloney. As a postdoc (Caltech, 2008-2010), with Antonio Rangel, we investigated neural mechanisms for sequential information integration and context-dependent valuation. I am currently an Associate Professor in the Institute of Neuroscience at National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan where my lab studies the neural and computational mechanisms of decision making.",12:30 PM,,Barchi Library (140 John Morgan Building),Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Shih-Wei Wu,11:30 AM,,Probability estimation and its neurocomputational substrates,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-shih-wei-wu,16-04-2019
"Tuesday, April 9, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of Biological SciencesUSCUnderstanding how inhibitory circuits in the thalamus contribute to visionThe thalamus is often viewed as a gatekeeper, relaying sensory signals to the cortex during waking and halting their flow during sleep. While true, this is an impoverished description. Our work explores how circuits in the visual thalamus contribute to sensory processing per se. Although thalamocortical cells make few local connections, they are embedded in two dense inhibitory networks. First, local interneurons supply feedforward inhibition; second, neurons in the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus (a thin sheet of gabaergic cells that cloak the thalamus) provide feedback inhibition. We use anatomical, physiological and computational tools to understand how each inhibitory network operates and we compare results across species to resolve evolutionarily conserved aspects of thalamic structure and function.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Judith Hirsch,11:30 AM,,Understanding how inhibitory circuits in the thalamus contribute to vision,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-judith-hirsch,09-04-2019
"Tuesday, April 2, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of NeurobiologyHarvard UniversityCortical dynamics for flexible navigation decisionsWe study flexible sensorimotor decision-making in mice during navigation-based tasks in virtual reality. I will present approaches to study this topic using analyses of population dynamics from calcium imaging movies, optogenetic perturbations, and measurements of behavioral variability. We have developed behavioral tasks in which mice integrate internally-stored contextual information, in the form of short-term memories, with sensory cues to guide navigation choices. We have used unbiased methods to identify regions of the mouse cortex involved in these tasks, leading to a particular focus on posterior parietal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and V1. I will present findings that parietal and retrosplenial areas use mixed representations of sensory and contextual information to generate navigational trajectories toward rewarded goal locations. I will discuss potential decision-related roles for these cortical regions for mapping sensory and internal information onto navigational actions.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Chris Harvey,11:30 AM,,Cortical dynamics for flexible navigation decisions,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-chris-harvey,02-04-2019

"Tuesday, March 19, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of Mathematics and Statistics Swarthmore CollegeReconstruction of Sparse Connectivity and Stimuli in Neuronal Networks Using Compressive Sensing of Network DynamicsSparsity is a fundamental characteristic of numerous biological, social, and technological networks. Neuronal network connectivity demonstrates sparsity on multiple spatial scales and natural stimuli typically also possess sparse representations in appropriate domains. In this talk, we address the role of sparsity in the efficient encoding of network structure and inputs through nonlinear neuronal network dynamics. We develop a theoretical framework for reconstructing sparse network data by leveraging compressive sensing theory and the linearity of input-output mappings commonly underlying neuronal dynamics. Addressing the theoretical and experimental challenges in measuring structural network connectivity, we reconstruct model neuronal network connections using the evoked dynamics in response to a small ensemble of random stimuli. Using the reconstructed connectivity matrix, we then accurately recover detailed network inputs distinct from the random input ensemble. Analyzing several receptive field models, we investigate how the accuracy of input reconstructions depends on the network architecture, and demonstrate that the center-surround structure common in the early visual system facilitates marked improvements in natural scene processing well beyond the uniformly-random connectivity typical in compressive sensing theory. However, we show that the spatial localization inherent in receptive fields combined with information loss introduced by nonlinear neuronal dynamics may underlie deficiencies in processing specific classes of non-natural stimuli, yielding a novel explanation for the manifestation of certain illusory effects. We expect this talk will provide a new perspective for understanding compressive encoding in sensory systems as well as the structure-function relationship in neuronal networks.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Victor Barranca,11:30 AM,,Reconstruction of Sparse Connectivity and Stimuli in Neuronal Networks Using Compressive Sensing of Network Dynamics,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-victor-barranca,19-03-2019
"Tuesday, March 12, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of NeuroscienceUniversity of PennsylvaniaThe caudate nucleus and reward-biased visual decisionsDecision making is a complex process that interprets sensory information within the context of reward contingency, task goal and intrinsic bias, etc. How and where this process is implemented in the brain remain unclear. The basal ganglia have been shown to contribute causally to reward-based economic decisions and to noisy sensory evidence-based perceptual decisions, leading to the hypothesis that sensory and reward information may be combined within the basal ganglia to support decision formation. In my talk, I will present our new results on how the caudate nucleus encodes combined signals at the single-neuron level and how disruption of caudate activity influences decision performance. These results further support the idea that the basal ganglia are a key player in the complex decision process.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Long Ding,11:30 AM,,The caudate nucleus and reward-biased visual decisions,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-long-ding-0,12-03-2019
"Tuesday, February 26, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of Psychological and Brain SciencesComputational Memory and Perception LabUniversity of Massachusetts AmherstBanishing Ghosts of Process from the Neural Machinery of Human Memory: A Representational Hierarchical Account of CognitionIn cognitive neuroscience, mental processes or cognitive functions have often served as labels for characterizing the functional division of labor in cortex. For example, distinct neuroanatomical substrates have been proposed for declarative memory versus perceptual learning, short-term versus long-term memory, and familiarity versus recollection. I will present theoretical and empirical work, including connectionist simulations, behavioral studies and fMRI data, that challenges process-based accounts of memory and visual cognition. Instead, I will argue that the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe (MTL) can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of representations – from simple features in V1, through feature-conjunctions in inferior temporal cortex, to complex conjunctions of items and context in MTL. Under this view, the processes that operate upon the representations to produce a behavioral output – e.g., “pattern completion” to produce recall of a memory – can occur anywhere along the hierarchy.The studies I will present demonstrate how a single brain region can support more than one cognitive process (visual discrimination and recognition memory); that a cognitive process (recollection) previously thought tied to one brain region (hippocampus) can also unfold elsewhere; and that this “Representational-Hierarchical” framework makes accurate predictions for the organization of representations within the ventral visual stream, and for the effects of aging on recognition memory. This suggests that it may be possible to banish the ghosts of process from the neural machinery of memory, and explain the neuroanatomical organization of cognition in terms of representations alone.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Rosie Cowell,11:30 AM,,Banishing Ghosts of Process from the Neural Machinery of Human Memory: A Representational Hierarchical Account of Cognition,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-rosie-cowell,26-02-2019
"Tuesday, February 19, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of NeurologyUniversity of PennsylvaniaWhen nano meets neuro: high-resolution interfaces for multimodal mapping neural circuit dynamicUnraveling neural processes underlying cognition, sensation, volitional movement, neurological and neuromuscular diseases requires decoding the activity of millions of neurons at millisecond resolution, over months to years and without inducing foreign-body reactions. These requirements exceed the capabilities of available neurotechnologies: non-invasive clinical tools provide coarse, indirect measurements of collective neural network behavior, but they fail to identify the microcircuits underlying function and disease. Implantable metal and silicon electrodes can directly interface with individual neurons, but suffer from poor longevity and invasiveness issues. Genetically-encoded tools for optically monitoring and manipulating neural activity, are beginning to reveal the brain’s wiring, but alone they provide sparse information on “fast” circuit activity and network connectivity.In this talk I will discuss how nanoscale materials can be engineered into high-resolution, minimally invasive, multimodal neuroelectronic interfaces, designed to seamlessly interface with and control the activity of neural circuits. In the first part of the talk I will present high-resolution, low noise microelectrodes based on MXene nanomaterials. I will illustrate the fundamental electrochemical properties of MXene nanomaterials compared to conventional metals and how these translate into significant impedance and noise reduction when MXenes are integrated into cellular-scale devices. I will then present two examples of custom-fabricated MXene microelectrodes optimized for neural recordings in different areas of the brain. In the second part of the talk I will introduce flexible, transparent graphene optoelectronic devices engineered to simultaneously acquire electrophysiology and functional calcium imaging data. I will present the fabrication process yielding functional electrodes with >90% broadband transparency and demonstrate their application in multimodal mapping seizure dynamics at high-spatiotemporal resolution, in vivo in animal models of epilepsy.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Flavia Vitale,11:30 AM,,When nano meets neuro: high-resolution interfaces for multimodal mapping neural circuit dynamic,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-flavia-vitale,19-02-2019
"Thursday, February 14, 2019 - 11:30am","Auditory Neurophysiology LaboratoryUniversity of SalamancaEmergence of deviance detection along the auditory neuroaxis and beyond: A neuronal correlate for predictive coding?The soundscape consists of a cacophony of multiple sources of sounds with complex properties overlapping temporally and spectrally. Nonetheless, what we can hear is an orderly acoustic stream organised according to sources and auditory objects, allowing us to distinguish deviant or novel events and select some sources or objects for further processing. Recent evidence suggests that these perceptual achievements are based on properties that are encoded at earlier stages of the auditory pathway.Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is the reduction in the responses to a common sound relative to the same sound when rare. It was originally described in the primary auditory cortex (A1) as the neuronal correlate of the mismatch negativity (MMN), an important component of the auditory event-related potentials that is elicited by changes in the auditory environment. However, the relationship between SSA and the MMN is still a subject of debate. The MMN is a mid-late potential (~150-200 ms in humans), and its neural sources have been located mainly within non-primary auditory cortex in humans and animal models. Moreover, SSA is also present as early as in the auditory midbrain and thalamus (IC and MGB).In this talk, I will show our recent findings on recordings from single neurons in the IC, MGB and auditory cortex (AC) of anaesthetized rats and awake mouse to an oddball paradigm similar to that used for MMN studies. Our data demonstrate that most neurons in the non-lemnical divisions of the auditory brain show strong SSA and that there is a hierarchical emergence of prediction error signals along the central auditory system. We have also observed that although GABAergic and/or glycinergic inhibition play a role in modulating SSA in the IC and MGB, it is acetylcholine that shapes SSA by differently affecting the response to the standard or deviant tones sounds only. More recently, we have also started to record from prefrontal cortex and observed that neurons show the highest degree of prediction error along the auditory hierarchy.Taken together our results unify three coexisting views of perceptual deviance detection at different levels of description: neuronal physiology, cognitive neuroscience and the theoretical predictive coding framework.Financial support was provided by the Spanish MINECO (Grant # SAF2016-75803-P), Junta de Castilla y León (Grant # SA023P17) and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 722098” to MSM.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Manuel Malmierca,11:30 AM,,Emergence of deviance detection along the auditory neuroaxis and beyond: A neuronal correlate for predictive coding?,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-manuel-malmierca,14-02-2019

  James H. Flory, MD, MSCE


  Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medical College, and an Assistant Attending on the Endocrinology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center


  I am an endocrinology fellow and board certified internist. My time and expertise are divided between patient care and academic research. 

  Clinically, my focus is in type 2 diabetes, with secondary interests in type 1 diabetes, bone health, and thyroid disease. I have particularly extensive experience managing these conditions in oncology patients.

  As a researcher, I am a specialist in using observational data (rather than clinical trial data) to study the safety and comparative effectiveness of medical treatments. I collaborate on projects in this area with investigators at Weill Cornell Medical College, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Food and Drug Administration. Some specific areas that I study are the safety and tolerability of metformin (the most widely used diabetes medication) and the optimal choice of second line drugs for diabetes after metformin. Methodologically my particular interests include the analysis of ‘messy’ longitudinal biomarker data using mixed linear models, missing data issues, instrumental variables, and simulation of clinical trials using observational results.", 10:00am,,"John Morgan Building, “Class of 62” 3620 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104",Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB),,9:00am ,,"CCEB Seminar- James Flory, MD, MSCE",http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/705922,23-05-2019

"Thursday, January 17","Abstract: Memory systems are on the verge of a renaissance:  Scalable, persistent main memories (e.g., Intel’s 3DXPoint) are the first new technology to enter the upper layers of the memory hierarchy in 50 years.  They bring a fundamentally new capability (i.e., persistence), a dramatic increase in capacity, and an array of complications (e.g., asymmetric read and write performance, power limitations, and wear out).  This combination of characteristics raises a deceptively simple but fundamental question:  What should we do with persistent main memory?  In this talk, I will describe several potential answers and the systems  my group has built to help understand how different answers affect performance, programmability, and other aspects of system design.   I’ll also highlight the central challenges that these memories present and try to summarize what we have learned about them.  Finally, I’ll describe what I see as the most interesting avenues for future work.              
Bio: Steven Swanson is a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego and the director of the Non-volatile Systems Laboratory.

"Tuesday, January 29","Abstract: Correctness and security problems in modern computer systems can result from problematic hardware event orderings and interleavings during an application’s execution. Since hardware designs are complex and since a single user-facing instruction can exhibit a variety of different hardware execution sequences, analyzing and verifying systems for correct event orderings is challenging.  My work addresses these challenges by combining hardware architecture and systems approaches with formal methods to support the specification, analysis, and verification of implementation-aware event ordering scenarios, with the specific goal of automatically synthesizing implementation-aware programs capable of violating correctness or security guarantees. In this talk, I will present two formal, early-stage verification tools and techniques rooted in this approach. TriCheck conducts axiomatic full-stack memory consistency model (MCM) verification (from high-level programming languages down through hardware implementations). Using rigorous and efficient formal approaches, TriCheck identified flaws in RISC-V’s draft MCM specification and two counterexamples to a previously proven-correct compiler mapping scheme from C11 to IBM Power and ARMv7. Noting that MCM and security analysis are amenable to similar approaches, CheckMate uses related axiomatic techniques to evaluate susceptibility of a hardware design and its related system support to formally-specified classes of security exploits; in response, it synthesizes proof-of-concept exploit code when a design is susceptible. CheckMate automatically synthesized programs representative of Meltdown and Spectre attacks as well as new exploits, MeltdownPrime and SpectrePrime, that I have demonstrated on Intel hardware.
Bio: Caroline Trippel is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University. She is advised by Professor Margaret Martonosi on her computer architecture dissertation research, specifically on the topic of concurrency and security verification in heterogeneous parallel systems. Her work bridges computer architecture and formal methods and demonstrates the importance of that bridge in specifying and verifying the correct and secure execution of software running on such systems. Trippel has influenced the design of the RISC-V ISA memory consistency model (MCM) both via full-stack MCM analysis of its draft specification and her subsequent participation in the RISC-V Memory Model Task Group; she received recognition for this work via the 2017-2018 NVIDIA Graduate Research Fellowship. Additionally, Trippel has developed a novel methodology and tool that synthesized two new variants of the recently publicized Meltdown and Spectre attacks; this work lead to a funded collaboration with Intel on side-channel attack research. She received her B.S. in Computer Engineering from Purdue University in 2013 and her M.A. in Computer Science from Princeton University in 2015. She will receive her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University in Spring 2019.",4:00 PM,,,CIS,,3:00 PM,,"Caroline Trippel Department of Computer Science Princeton University Title: ""Made to Order: Verifying Correctness and Security of Hardware through Event Orderings""",http://www.cis.upenn.edu/about-cis/events/index.php,29-01-2019

"May. 13, 2019 5:00pm to 6:30pm","In a world beset by serious and unconscionable health disparities, by dangerous contagions that can circle our globalized planet in hours, and by a bewildering confusion of health actors and systems, humankind needs a new vision, a new architecture, new coordination among renewed systems to ensure central health capabilities for all. Dr. Jennifer Prah Ruger's book Global Health Justice and Governance (Oxford University Press, 2018) lays out the critical problems facing the world today and offers a new theory of justice and governance as a way to resolve these seemingly intractable issues.
In this conversation with author Dr. Jennifer Prah Ruger and Perry World House Deputy Director LaShawn R. Jefferson, Dr. Prah Ruger will address the fundamental responsibility of society to ensure human flourishing; the central role that health plays in flourishing and how that places a unique claim on our public institutions and resources to ensure central health capabilities to reduce premature death and avoid preventable morbidities; and the new global health architecture that is desperately needed in order to address staggering inequalities, imperiling epidemics, and inadequate systems.
Jennifer Prah Ruger is the Amartya Sen Professor of Health Equity, Economics, and Policy in the School of Social Policy & Practice (SP2) and the former Associate Dean for Global Studies and Faculty Chair at the Center for High Impact Philanthropy (CHIP) at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Prah Ruger is the founder and director of the Health Equity and Policy Lab (HEPL) that conducts quantitative and qualitative research on the equity implications of health and social policies. She served previously at the World Bank as speechwriter to president James D. Wolfensohn and on the health and development satellite secretariat of WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland’s Transition Team.",6:30pm,,Perry World House  3803 Locust Walk,Leonard & Davis Institute (LDI),,5:00pm,,"Special Book Event with Jennifer Prah Ruger (""Global Health Justice and Governance"")",https://ldi.upenn.edu/event/special-book-event-jennifer-prah-ruger,13-05-2019

"May. 17, 2019 3:00pm to 4:30pm","Dr. Shah brings over twenty years of experience in business, government, and philanthropy to The Rockefeller Foundation. Appointed as USAID Administrator by President Obama in 2009, and unanimously confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Shah was charged with reshaping the $20 billion agency’s operations to provide greater assistance to pressing development challenges around the globe. By elevating the importance of innovation, promoting public-private partnerships, rethinking internal practices, and shifting how dollars were spent to deliver stronger results, Shah secured bipartisan support that enabled USAID to dramatically accelerate its work to end extreme poverty. Despite partisan gridlock on many issues, two significant Presidential priorities – Feed the Future and Power Africa – passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support and were signed into law by President Obama, and the Global Food Security Act is the second largest global development legislation after PEPFAR. Shah’s work delivered results for countries facing democratic transitions, post-conflict situations, and humanitarian crises, and is widely credited with providing life-saving access to food, health, and water for millions of children across the planet.
When Dr. Shah left USAID in 2015, he continued to follow his passion for creating opportunities for communities to thrive in the developing world by founding Latitude Capital, a private equity firm focused on power and infrastructure projects in Africa and Asia. He was also appointed a Distinguished Fellow in Residence at Georgetown University.
Raised outside of Detroit, Michigan, Dr. Shah is a graduate of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and the Wharton School of Business. Prior to his appointment at USAID, Shah served as Chief Scientist and Undersecretary for Research, Education and Economics at the United States Department of Agriculture. He also served in a number of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where he helped launch the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (a joint venture by the Gates and Rockefeller foundations) and the International Financing Facility for Immunization (credited with raising more than $5 billion for childhood immunizations worldwide) and where he supported the creation of the Global Development Program. He and his wife, Shivam Mallick Shah have three children.

"Friday, May 10, 2019 - 9:00am to 4:00pm","Event Information: The Fels Institute of Government hosts a semi-annual public policy symposium that shines a light on what local and state government officials are doing to address nationally relevant issues in Philadelphia. This semester’s symposium will address the burgeoning opioid crisis by evaluating how public policy can stem the ever-growing number of newly addicted individuals. Government officials have dedicated a substantial amount of resources and attention to treating people who are already addicted to opioids, but less resources have been dedicated to addressing some of the root causes of an individual’s addiction.
Attendees will wrestle with how an individual gets addicted to opioids, the trajectory of their addiction, and the impact of overprescribing of opioids by the medical community. The discussion will also explore what lessons the policy community has learned from the opioid crisis that can be used to prevent and address the next potential drug crisis.

"Tuesday, May 14, 2019","Join us for a Lunchtime Lecture by Rocio Gomez, a Science Institute Fellow. While historians of science emphasize scientists in Europe, such as Marie Curie and Alexander von Humboldt, scientists in Latin America rarely receive a mention. Even historians of Latin America neglect scientists in their discussions of institutions. Using letters and scientific treatises, Gomez’s project examines the work of chemist and engineer Andrés Manuel del Río (1764–1849). Gomez will argue that del Río encountered bias against Mexican science despite his discovery of the element vanadium. This finding coincided with the turmoil of the Wars of Independence in Mexico (1810–1821), which emphasized geopolitical rifts and a break with European institutions. Vanadium’s importance reaches into the 20th century as it becomes crucial to the steel industry and the war effort. This talk will examine how del Río’s discovery shaped technology in the Wars of Independence in Mexico and the World War II effort while spurring the mining industry on both sides of the border. Rocio Gomez Rocio Gomez is an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas and holds a PhD in Latin American history from the University of Arizona. Her research interests include Latin America, history of science, environmental history, and the history of medicine. At the Science History Institute she will be exploring the work of Andrés Manuel del Rio (1764–1849) and his scientific contributions to the history of chemistry, geology, and the modern mining sector. Her first book, Silver Veins and Dusty Lungs: Water, Public Health, and the Environmental Legacies of Industry in Modern Mexico, 1834–1945 (University of Nebraska Press, forthcoming), explores the effects of silver mining on the human body and water systems in Zacatecas, Mexico.",1:00 p.m.,,"Science History Institute315 Chestnut Street, Science History Institute, 315 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106",Science History Institute,,12:00 p.m.,,"To Victory with Vanadium!

"Tuesday, May 21, 2019","Join us for a Lunchtime Lecture by Alexandre Hocquet and Frédéric Wieber, Otlet Fellows at the Science History Institute. Computational chemistry is a scientific field within which the computer is a pivotal element. This scientific community emerged in the 1980s and was involved with two major industries: the computer manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry, the latter becoming a potential market for the former through molecular-modeling software packages. Hocquet and Wieber will address the difficult relationships between scientific modeling methods and the software that implemented these methods throughout the 1990s. Developing, using, licensing, and distributing software leads to multiple tensions among the actors in intertwined academic and industrial contexts. In order to understand these tensions, Hocquet and Wieber explore the Computational Chemistry List. This mailing list, created in 1991, constitutes a natively digital kind of corpus that reveals how issues of theories, methods, code, reproducibility of results, epistemic transparency, intellectual property, user management, and the commercialization of software are articulated Alexandre Hocquet and Frédéric Wieber

"March 28, 2019","Professor Shoemaker from University of Wisconsin Law School will present his paper “The Devil’s Justice”.


  Abstract: “Among the most underappreciated aspects of the devil’s medieval career is that he was once the lead plaintiff in the world’s most spectacularly ambitious lawsuit. He lost. He was defeated by the arguments of a woman, the Virgin Mary. The bitter defeat was amplified by the fact that the judge in the case was the very same person the devil had accused of violently despoiling him of the human souls whose ownership was in dispute. In hindsight, the loss might be what social scientists call overdetermined. The venue for the suit – heaven – and the day of the trial – Good Friday – were certainly not auspicious. Nonetheless, the devil initiated his lawsuit supremely confident that he would prevail. His confidence rested upon his belief that both the applicable laws and the overarching principles of justice were entirely on his side.


  It was that the lawsuit contained the “preposterous” image of a woman serving in the role of lawyer.  Perhaps worst of all, the outcome of the case did not turn solely on rational legal argumentation – the give and take of reasons and responses - but also, as we will see below, upon the tears of an emotionally overwrought woman. Serious scholars, he stressed, would not waste time with the text.

  Anna Lvovsky is an Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, where she teaches American legal history, the history of policing, criminal law, and evidence. Professor Lvovsky’s scholarship focuses on the legal and cultural dimensions of policing, judicial uses of professional knowledge, and the regulation of gender, sexuality, and morality. Her recent work examines judicial deference to police expertise and the role of moral judgment in the Supreme Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.


  Professor Lvovsky’s book project, Queer Expertise: Urban Policing and the Discovery of the Gay World, 1920-1970, under contract with the University of Chicago Press, examines how the police drew on a combination of scientific expertise and lay stereotype about homosexuality to shape the legal status of gay men in the United States. As a dissertation, the project received the 2016 Julien Mezey Dissertation Award from the Association for the Study of Law, Culture, and the Humanities.


  Prior to joining HLS, Professor Lvovsky was an Academic Fellow at Columbia Law School. She clerked for Judge Michael Boudin of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and for Judge Gerard E.

"November 5, 2018","Professor Hirota’s current book project, “The Business of the Nation: Foreign Contract Labor and the Rise of American Immigration Control,” examines the transnational business of importing Asian, Canadian, European, and Mexican contract laborers to the United States and the evolution of federal alien contract labor law designed to restrict this form of immigration over the course of the long nineteenth century. Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers’ antipathy to “alien contract labor” resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.


   


  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) “pauper labor” discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.

"November 27, 2017","Between 1967 and 1979, the United States’ divorce rate doubled. The rapidly rising divorce rate created a widespread crisis among women who had relied on their husbands for economic support and access to social insurance benefits such as Social Security and health insurance. In reponse, a now-forgotten strand of the 1970s feminist movement, which I call “the feminist divorce reform movement,” emerged and organized itself around securing women’s place in the United States’ marriage-based insurance system. This paper, part of a larger project on this movement, examines divorce’s decreasing political salience as more and more women entered the permanent workforce. In the 1970s, one-third of married American women were in the paid labor force. By 1985 that number had shot up. Even women with young children were now as likely to be found in the workforce as at home: around 50 percent of mothers with children under three and roughly 70 percent of mothers with children over six were in the labor force. In response, feminists who had once focused on shoring up the marriage-based insurance system turned their efforts toward securing women’s place in the employment-based insurance system. In this paper I consider how legislative battles over the Family and Medical Leave Act, universal child care, and welfare reform fit into a longer history of feminist activism dedicated to creating a social insurance system that protected women from the economic vulnerabilities created by their carework obligations.

"October 11, 2017","Professor Elizabeth Papp Kamali, an Assistant Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, will be presenting her paper Trial by Ordeal by Jury in Medieval England, or Saints and Sinners in Literature and Law.


   


  Using a miracle tale as a focal point, this paper illuminates the political and cultural context of York at the turn of the twelfth to thirteenth century in order to make sense of England’s rapid transition from trial by ordeal to trial by jury after 1215. More specifically, the paper highlights the possible impact of the period of papal interdict (c. 1208 – 1214), imposed by Pope Innocent III in response to King John’s intransigence over the appointment of a new archbishop of Canterbury, during this transitional period in criminal procedure. It argues that the interdict, with its suspension of liturgies, might have forced experimentation with alternative means of reaching verdicts in felony cases. The paper also suggests that juries might have been involved in the issuance of ordeal verdicts in the late ordeal period in England, in which case the shift from trial by ordeal to trial by jury may be less a moment of rupture than a transition from one form of trial using juries to another, albeit a trial form more starkly desacralized after 1215. It is the author’s hope that the paper will serve as a starting point for further research, not a decisive answer to the questions it raises, including whether England’s rapid adoption of final jury verdicts may owe something to the tussle between King John and a particularly imperial and imperious pope.

Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called ""Entertaining Science"" at Cornelia Street Café in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended Hückel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).",6:30pm,,"Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street",Wolf Humanities Center Events,,5:00pm,,The Allure of Indigo,http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/allure-indigo,22-10-2014
"Saturday, 1 November 2014—Saturday, 20 December 2014","The exhibition examines how artists have engaged with ideas of homeland and belonging that fail to cohere to a unitary sense of time or place. Through film, photography and performance, the artists in this exhibition explore the contours of belonging across different contexts - from the invention of nationalist social rituals to the homecoming of veterans, from the trope of the ""haunted"" house to that of the family portrait. By bringing together the work of an international group of artists approaching home as a volatile concept, this exhibition examines how fantasies of belonging involve complex psychic and affective responses to specific material and historical conditions informed by race, gender, sexuality and class.""Itinerant Belongings"" grounds this inquiry by revisiting critical debates that bridged activism and art in the 1980s and 1990s. Responding to the presence of the homeless, the displaced, and the disenfranchised in American cities, two of the artists in the exhibition, William Pope.L and Krzysztof Wodiczko, produced projects in this critical moment that questioned the very notion of what it meant for a space to be ""public."" This exhibition aims to reanimate this dialogue and extend it to a contemporary global landscape marked by mass displacement, armed conflict, and debates around borders and immigration.Work by Yael Bartana, Jamie Diamond, Andrew Moore, William Pope.L, Paul Salveson, Jessica Vaughn, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Krzysztof Wodiczko will be on display at Slought and the Addams Gallery at PennDesign, and viewers are encouraged to take an itinerant path from one exhibition site to another.

Anthropologist and paleobiologist Nina Jablonski discusses her groundbreaking research on the physical evolution of skin color in humans and how its meanings, associations, and values have changed over time.
Nina G. Jablonski is a biological anthropologist and paleobiologist who studies the evolution of adaptations to the environment in Old World primates including humans. Her work is focused in two major areas. Her paleoanthropological research concerns the evolutionary history of Old World monkeys, and currently includes an active field project in China. Her research on the evolution of human adaptations to the environment centers on how human skin and skin pigmentation have evolved over time, and includes an active field project examining the relation between skin pigmentation and vitamin D production.Professor Jablonski is currently collaborating on the development of new approaches to science education in the United States. These approaches have the dual aims of improving the understanding of evolution and human diversity, and of stimulating interest among students in pursuing STEM courses and careers. With the support of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) and active collaboration of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., she is leading a group of 30 scholars in the development of ""genetics and genealogy"" curricula for K-12 and college undergraduate students.She also leads a major new scholarly effort to study the effects of race in South African society.

"Wednesday, 10 December 2014 - 5:00pm—6:30pm","The brilliant colors of butterfly wings reveal much about aesthetics, evolution, and engineering. How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.
Using holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.
In 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation. And in 2011, she was selected by the National Academy of Engineering to present at the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. In addition to being widely published, Dr. Yang holds over 20 patents, issued or pending.

Moderated by Penn urban design professor Amy Hillier, the event will feature site-specific mural projects from around the city.Jane Golden, as the driving force behind the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, is a true agent of social change, a Philadelphia phenom. Conceived as an anti-graffiti program in 1984, the Mural Arts Program has under Golden's leadership produced over 3600 landmark works of public art in nearly every neighborhood throughout the city. What do these murals embody? So much—about what transforms places, people, communities, and institutions. Read the program's mission statement: ""We believe art ignites change."" Live its golden rule: ""When we create art with each other and for each other, the force of life can triumph."" And celebrate its ""Palette of Core Values."" Do these things, and you will know why Jane Golden has been honored with so many awards, among them the Philadelphia Award, the Hepburn Medal, the 2012 Governor's Award for Innovation in the Arts, and the Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania Award.Betsy Casañas is a studio and public mural artist, a community activist, and an educator who was born and raised in the heart of ""The Badlands"" of North Philadelphia's barrio. She received her BFA from Moore College of Art and Design, and has worked in the Latino community since 1994. Casañas has exhibited her work in various solo and group exhibits and has designed over 40 public murals and mosaics nationally and internationally. In 2007 she cofounded The Semilla Arts, a grassroots initiative that uses collaborative art as a means of empowering people and communities in underserved areas. In 2010 she opened ""A Seed of Diamond Gallery,"" a community space where artists of different cultural background gather to tell their stories through spoken word, music, and visual arts.Ernel Martinez was inspired to become a mural artist while a PennDesign student in Jane Golden's class on public art at the University of Pennsylvania, where one of his mentors was Terry Adkins.

"Friday, 20 February 2015 - 10:00am—5:00pm","This symposium is an opportunity to prompt conversations among artists and academics across multiple disciplines on the history of political, economic and aesthetic values attached to color. Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color—how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt? To what degree is color a 'natural' or physical property and in what ways is it a rhetorical or cultural construction? And, how do institutions assign value to color?

Called synesthesia, this human perceptual condition in which information between the senses is blended has long fascinated scientists and laypeople alike. Award-winning neuroscientist and New York Times bestselling author David Eagleman presents new findings from his research into the behavioral, neurological, and genetic characteristics of synesthetes.
There are an infinite number of boring things to do in science. But we live these short life spans. Why not do the thing that's the coolest thing in the world to do? —David Eagleman, The New Yorker

David Eagleman is best known for his work on time perception, synesthesia, and neurolaw. He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.
In 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.
One of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada). Also in Fall 2015, Eagleman will host the new PBS science series, ""The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman.""
From the Eagleman Laboratory website, in his own words:""Public understanding of science is a passion of mine, and to that end I have written for the New York Times, Discover Magazine, Atlantic, The Week, Slate, Wired, New Scientist, and others. I speak often on National Public Radio and BBC to discuss what's new and important in science. I have founded a prize in mathematics and physics.""I am fortunate to be a Guggenheim Fellow. Within the scientific community, I serve as an editor for Journal of Vision, PLoS One, and Seminars in Brain and Consciousness. I also serve on the board of directors for several organizations, including The Long Now Foundation.""My book of fiction, Sum, was lucky enough to become an international bestseller. It has been translated into 27 languages and was named a Best Book of the Year by Barnes and Noble, New Scientist, and the Chicago Tribune. British musician Brian Eno and I performed a musical reading of Sum at the Sydney Opera House, and German composer Max Richter translated Sum into a full opera at the Royal Opera House in London.""My neuroscience book Incognito became a New York Times bestseller, and was named a Book of the Year by Amazon, Goodreads, Houston Chronicle, and Boston Globe.

,"Courses Offered During Summer Session 1: May 28 - July 3
COMM 125: Communication Behavior (Pawel Popiel and Celeste M. Wagner)
This course introduces students to exploring communication and behavior, with a focus on mass and social media processes and effects. Topics include: the influence of social media on social relationships; the effects of biased media representations of social groups; the emotional experiences underlying the consumption of media, including for mood management; the political economy of the media industries; the political role and impact of the news media; the social and political impact of social media use; and other current topics. The aim of the course is to provide students with (1) a general understanding of research design and methods for the study of  communication, and (2) the basic conceptual tools needed to critically evaluate the findings, assumptions, theories, and methods examining communication behavior and media effects. The class will survey social scientific, critical, and cultural studies approaches to understanding communication and media processes, and their broader social implications. Students who take this course will acquire the tools to better understand and conceptualize issues and problems related to communication, and mass and social media prevalent today.
COMM 225: Children and Media (Leeann Siegel)
This course examines children's relationship to media in its historic, economic, political, and social contexts. The class explores the ways in which ""childhood"" is created and understood as a time of life that is qualitatively unique and socially constructed over time. It continues with a review of various theories of child development as they inform children's relationship with and understanding of media. It next reviews public policies designed to empower parents and limit children's exposure to potentially problematic media content and simultaneously considers the economic forces that shape what children see and buy. The course concludes with a critical examination of research on the impact of media on children's physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development. Students in this course produce a prototype for an educational children's media property as their capstone project.
COMM 290: Visual Culture and Communication (Jasmine Erdener and Hanna E. Morris)
This course will introduce students to foundational aspects of visual communication theory and practice with particular attention to contemporary culture in the United States. Course readings will engage with critical questions of power, representation and ways of seeing in an increasingly globalized and digitally mediated context. Class discussions will unpack the power dynamics and visual regimes of race, gender, class, and citizenship. Historical case studies will supplement contemporary discussions of the visual. A key theme of this course will be creative forms of subversion and resistance—or, the “image politics” of visual communication. This course will be grounded in the everyday and will draw upon current events and contemporary controversies. Students will become well versed in the study and practice of visual communication—with the option of producing a final creative visual project or critical critique depending on students’ interests.
Courses Offered During Summer Session 2: July 5 - August 9
COMM 130: Media Industries and Society (Lauren Bridges and Diami Virgilio)
The aim of this course is to prepare you to work in the media business as well as to be an informed citizen by acquainting you with the work and language of media practitioners. The class also investigates the exciting, and (to some employed there) scary changes taking place in the news and publishing industry, the advertising industry, the movie industry, and several other areas of the media system. In doing that, the course ranges over economic, political, legal, historical, and ""cultural"" considerations that shape what we see when we go online, use social media, watch TV, read books, play video games, and more. You'll never look at media the same way again.
COMM 339: Critical Perspectives in Journalism (Jennifer R. Henrichsen)
Journalists and the role of journalism in democratic societies is frequently in the headlines and of increasing importance to our national debate. This course will draw from the headlines and key scholars to provide undergraduate students with a critical understanding of and orientation toward journalism. Students will read theoretical selections and commentary by and about journalists. Students will analyze and contextualize readings related to current events. Specific attention will be paid to the changing roles of journalists amidst significant technological and political change. A comparative lens of journalism in different cultural contexts will also occur. Students will engage with different models of journalistic practice; changing norms, values, sourcing practices; and journalism ethics. Class will comprise of lecture, discussion, and engagement with various forms of news media, including articles and documentaries. The majority of class will be a structured seminar in which students will discuss the required readings within the context of current events and the overarching context of the class. Students should come to each class prepared to discuss, ask questions, and engage in constructive ways with their fellow students and their instructor.
Courses Offered During 11-Week Session: May 21 - August 3
COMM 290: The Internet: Then, Now, and Right Now (Ryan Tsapatsaris)
Through a series of case-studies, this course will seek to answer the questions “how do people behave online” and “when and how are online behaviors specific or universal”. The course will primarily focus on contemporary behaviors in spaces like YouTube, Facebook, (Black) Twitter, Grindr, Tinder, Myspace, and MMORPGs (World of Warcraft) along with a brief analysis of the early web spaces of the 1970s-1990s. It will also explore cultural production, such as memes, and other user-generated content. In the final weeks of the course, we will examine contemporary Internet happenings from Summer 2019 and investigate how current behaviors are similar and dissimilar from historical practices. While previous familiarity with various Internet spaces will be helpful, this course is meant as a primer, and as such, will make no assumptions about students’ prior knowledge of the myriad sites being analyzed.  That being said, students will be encouraged to discuss spaces they engage with online that may not appear in the assigned readings.
COMM 491: Communications Internship (Susan Haas)
A scholarly counterpart for students' internships in various communication-related organizations. Through individually-selected readings, class discussion and individual conferences, students develop their own independent research agendas which investigate aspects of their internship experience or industry. In written field notes and a final paper, students combine communication theory and practice in pursuit of their individual questions. Class date and time to be determined by enrolled students schedules.

An emerging body of research begins to shed light on various aspects  of college promise programs (including free tuition programs), but too  little is known about the full range of program outcomes, or the ideal  structure and design of programs serving different groups of students in  different sectors of higher education in different communities,  regions, and states.
This research conference, to be held October  19-20, 2017 on the University of Pennsylvania campus, is designed to  stimulate production of a set of papers that collectively address the  following questions:
What are the characteristics of students  who participate in promise programs? How do characteristics of  participating students vary based on program characteristics?
What are the outcomes of promise programs for participating students?
What are the outcomes of promise programs for other stakeholders,  including K-12 schools, colleges and universities, and communities?
How do program outcomes for students and other stakeholders vary based on program characteristics?

""For over 20 years, I've wanted to thank the two police officers who responded when I finally called for help after a particularly vicious beating by my husband. Before that night, I'd hidden the abuse to protect my husband, and because I hoped we could save our marriage. I didn't think anyone could understand how crazy it felt to be trapped in an abusive relationship. Those police officers, whose names I still don't know, understood what I was experiencing. They helped make that night the last time he assaulted me. Intervening in an abusive relationship can be dangerous, challenging work for police, advocates, family and friends. But victims usually can't leave without community intervention and support. Police who know what to say and how to help a victim reeling from abuse are invaluable. Thank you to all the police officers who respond to 911 calls from abuse victims. Your work matters. Your work saved my life.""",,,,Ortner Center for Violence and Abuse in Relationships,,,,"Leslie Morgan Steiner: Thank You to the Police Who Helped Me Leave My Abusive Husband - Nov. 10, 2017",http://ortnercenter.org/updates/2017/11/10/leslie-morgan-steiner-thank-you-to-the-police-who-helped-me-leave-my-abusive-husband,10-11-2017
