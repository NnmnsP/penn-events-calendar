# Frontend for Penn events

You can run front-end site by the following

```sh
# only once on first time
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

By default, this will concurrently run Gatsby frontend site at port `8000`, hug API backend at port `8888`, 
and ElasticSearch at port `9200`. For deployment, use `npm run deploy` instead. This will run the site at port `9000`.
