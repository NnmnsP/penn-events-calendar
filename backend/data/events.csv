"Tuesday, April 30, 2019 - 11:30am","Cold Spring Harbor LaboratoryDiscovering dynamic states of neural populationsNeural responses and behavior are influenced by internal brain states, such as arousal or task context. Ongoing variations of these internal states affect global patterns of neural activity, giving rise to apparent variability of neural responses under the same experimental conditions. Uncovering dynamics of internal states from data proved difficult with traditional techniques based on trial-averaged responses of single neurons. In this talk, I will describe our recent work leveraging multi-electrode neural activity recordings and computational models to reveal internal-state dynamics of neural populations during perception and goal-directed behavior. I will show how endogenous fluctuations of ensemble neural activity in the primate visual cortex depend on the global arousal and selective attention. The spatiotemporal structure of these fluctuations accounts for correlated variability across cortical layers and columns. I will then present a broadly applicable, non-parametric framework for discovering neural population dynamics directly from the data without a priori model assumptions. The framework uncovers dynamic computations from large-scale neural recordings with single-neuron, single-spike resolution.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Tatiana Engel,11:30 AM,,Discovering dynamic states of neural populations,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-tatiana-engel,30-04-2019
"Tuesday, April 16, 2019 - 11:30am","Institute of NeuroscienceNational Yang-Ming UniversityProbability estimation and its neurocomputational substratesMany decisions we make depend on how we evaluate potential outcomes and estimate their probabilities of occurrence. Outcome valuation is subjective – it requires consulting the decision maker’s internal preferences and is sensitive to context. Probability estimation is also subjective – but requires the decision maker to first extract statistics from the environment before using them to estimate probability. Currently, it is unclear whether the two computations share similar algorithms and neural-algorithmic implementations.I will present our recent work on context-dependent probability estimation, which we identified both similarities and differences in computational mechanisms between valuation and probability estimation. I will also talk about work on modeling probability estimation as Bayesian inference, which focuses on examining how and how well people estimate probability of reward in the presence of prior and likelihood information. Here we found suboptimal performance similar to base-rate neglect, which surprisingly is robust across a wide variety of setups that try to eliminate this behavior. Together, these results suggest many interesting aspects of probability estimation that have yet to be fully understood at the behavioral, computational, and neural algorithmic levels.Bio: I obtained my PhD (2008) from New York University working on representations and use of probability information in decision making under risk with Larry Maloney. As a postdoc (Caltech, 2008-2010), with Antonio Rangel, we investigated neural mechanisms for sequential information integration and context-dependent valuation. I am currently an Associate Professor in the Institute of Neuroscience at National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan where my lab studies the neural and computational mechanisms of decision making.",12:30 PM,,Barchi Library (140 John Morgan Building),Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Shih-Wei Wu,11:30 AM,,Probability estimation and its neurocomputational substrates,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-shih-wei-wu,16-04-2019
"Tuesday, April 9, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of Biological SciencesUSCUnderstanding how inhibitory circuits in the thalamus contribute to visionThe thalamus is often viewed as a gatekeeper, relaying sensory signals to the cortex during waking and halting their flow during sleep. While true, this is an impoverished description. Our work explores how circuits in the visual thalamus contribute to sensory processing per se. Although thalamocortical cells make few local connections, they are embedded in two dense inhibitory networks. First, local interneurons supply feedforward inhibition; second, neurons in the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus (a thin sheet of gabaergic cells that cloak the thalamus) provide feedback inhibition. We use anatomical, physiological and computational tools to understand how each inhibitory network operates and we compare results across species to resolve evolutionarily conserved aspects of thalamic structure and function.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Judith Hirsch,11:30 AM,,Understanding how inhibitory circuits in the thalamus contribute to vision,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-judith-hirsch,09-04-2019
"Tuesday, April 2, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of NeurobiologyHarvard UniversityCortical dynamics for flexible navigation decisionsWe study flexible sensorimotor decision-making in mice during navigation-based tasks in virtual reality. I will present approaches to study this topic using analyses of population dynamics from calcium imaging movies, optogenetic perturbations, and measurements of behavioral variability. We have developed behavioral tasks in which mice integrate internally-stored contextual information, in the form of short-term memories, with sensory cues to guide navigation choices. We have used unbiased methods to identify regions of the mouse cortex involved in these tasks, leading to a particular focus on posterior parietal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and V1. I will present findings that parietal and retrosplenial areas use mixed representations of sensory and contextual information to generate navigational trajectories toward rewarded goal locations. I will discuss potential decision-related roles for these cortical regions for mapping sensory and internal information onto navigational actions.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Chris Harvey,11:30 AM,,Cortical dynamics for flexible navigation decisions,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-chris-harvey,02-04-2019

"Tuesday, March 19, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of Mathematics and Statistics Swarthmore CollegeReconstruction of Sparse Connectivity and Stimuli in Neuronal Networks Using Compressive Sensing of Network DynamicsSparsity is a fundamental characteristic of numerous biological, social, and technological networks. Neuronal network connectivity demonstrates sparsity on multiple spatial scales and natural stimuli typically also possess sparse representations in appropriate domains. In this talk, we address the role of sparsity in the efficient encoding of network structure and inputs through nonlinear neuronal network dynamics. We develop a theoretical framework for reconstructing sparse network data by leveraging compressive sensing theory and the linearity of input-output mappings commonly underlying neuronal dynamics. Addressing the theoretical and experimental challenges in measuring structural network connectivity, we reconstruct model neuronal network connections using the evoked dynamics in response to a small ensemble of random stimuli. Using the reconstructed connectivity matrix, we then accurately recover detailed network inputs distinct from the random input ensemble. Analyzing several receptive field models, we investigate how the accuracy of input reconstructions depends on the network architecture, and demonstrate that the center-surround structure common in the early visual system facilitates marked improvements in natural scene processing well beyond the uniformly-random connectivity typical in compressive sensing theory. However, we show that the spatial localization inherent in receptive fields combined with information loss introduced by nonlinear neuronal dynamics may underlie deficiencies in processing specific classes of non-natural stimuli, yielding a novel explanation for the manifestation of certain illusory effects. We expect this talk will provide a new perspective for understanding compressive encoding in sensory systems as well as the structure-function relationship in neuronal networks.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Victor Barranca,11:30 AM,,Reconstruction of Sparse Connectivity and Stimuli in Neuronal Networks Using Compressive Sensing of Network Dynamics,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-victor-barranca,19-03-2019
"Tuesday, March 12, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of NeuroscienceUniversity of PennsylvaniaThe caudate nucleus and reward-biased visual decisionsDecision making is a complex process that interprets sensory information within the context of reward contingency, task goal and intrinsic bias, etc. How and where this process is implemented in the brain remain unclear. The basal ganglia have been shown to contribute causally to reward-based economic decisions and to noisy sensory evidence-based perceptual decisions, leading to the hypothesis that sensory and reward information may be combined within the basal ganglia to support decision formation. In my talk, I will present our new results on how the caudate nucleus encodes combined signals at the single-neuron level and how disruption of caudate activity influences decision performance. These results further support the idea that the basal ganglia are a key player in the complex decision process.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Long Ding,11:30 AM,,The caudate nucleus and reward-biased visual decisions,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-long-ding-0,12-03-2019
"Tuesday, February 26, 2019 - 11:30am","Department of Psychological and Brain SciencesComputational Memory and Perception LabUniversity of Massachusetts AmherstBanishing Ghosts of Process from the Neural Machinery of Human Memory: A Representational Hierarchical Account of CognitionIn cognitive neuroscience, mental processes or cognitive functions have often served as labels for characterizing the functional division of labor in cortex. For example, distinct neuroanatomical substrates have been proposed for declarative memory versus perceptual learning, short-term versus long-term memory, and familiarity versus recollection. I will present theoretical and empirical work, including connectionist simulations, behavioral studies and fMRI data, that challenges process-based accounts of memory and visual cognition. Instead, I will argue that the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe (MTL) can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of representations – from simple features in V1, through feature-conjunctions in inferior temporal cortex, to complex conjunctions of items and context in MTL. Under this view, the processes that operate upon the representations to produce a behavioral output – e.g., “pattern completion” to produce recall of a memory – can occur anywhere along the hierarchy.The studies I will present demonstrate how a single brain region can support more than one cognitive process (visual discrimination and recognition memory); that a cognitive process (recollection) previously thought tied to one brain region (hippocampus) can also unfold elsewhere; and that this “Representational-Hierarchical” framework makes accurate predictions for the organization of representations within the ventral visual stream, and for the effects of aging on recognition memory. This suggests that it may be possible to banish the ghosts of process from the neural machinery of memory, and explain the neuroanatomical organization of cognition in terms of representations alone.",12:30 PM,,"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building",Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI),Rosie Cowell,11:30 AM,,Banishing Ghosts of Process from the Neural Machinery of Human Memory: A Representational Hierarchical Account of Cognition,https://cni.upenn.edu/events/cni-seminar-rosie-cowell,26-02-2019

"Wednesday, October 9, 2019 - 12:00pm","Title: Unintelligent Decisions: Discovery in the Context of Guilty Pleas
Abstract:
Criminal discovery rules vary by state and by adjudication mode. Whereas some states have restrictive policies about what types of evidence be turned over to the defense and when, other states have adopted “open-file” discovery policies such that essentially the entire case file be made available to the defense. To some degree, open-file policies have been adopted as a response to reducing wrongful convictions and deterring prosecutor’s withholding of exculpatory evidence. In the context of trials, prosecutors must turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense; to not do so is considered misconduct (i.e., Brady violations). However, in the context of guilty pleas--which account for 95% of convictions--whether, and what forms of, exculpatory evidence need be disclosed is much less clear. In this presentation, Professor Redlich will present her program of research examining prosecutor and defendant plea decision-making under varying discovery policies.",01:00 PM,,"395 McNeil Building

Scholarship about genocidal activity at the local level, however is still in its infancy.

Drawing upon primary sources from Ottoman, Armenian, British and French archives, as well as from memoirs and personal papers, the first part of the talk examines the efforts of some of Aintab’s most prominent citizens to get the central government to expel the district’s Armenians.

"September 27, 2019","Levels of organization and their use in science have received increased philosophical attention of late, including challenges to the well-foundedness or widespread usefulness of levels concepts. One kind of response to these challenges has been to advocate a more precise and specific levels concept that is coherent and useful. Another kind of response has been to argue that the levels concept should be taken as a heuristic, to embrace its ambiguity and the possibility of exceptions as acceptable consequences of its usefulness. In this talk, I suggest that each of these strategies faces its own attendant downsides, and that pursuit of both strategies (by different thinkers) compounds the difficulties. That both kinds of approaches are advocated is, I think, illustrative of the problems plaguing the concept of levels of organization. I end by suggesting that the invocation of levels may mislead scientific and philosophical investigations more than it informs them, so our use of the levels concept should be updated accordingly.",,,Cohen 402,Department of Philosophy,,3:00pm,,Colloquium: Angela Potochnik,https://philosophy.sas.upenn.edu/events/colloquium-angela-potochnik,27-09-2019

Even before Jonathan Shay's groundbreaking study, Achilles in Vietnam (1994), the Iliad served as both a guide to what war means for human beings and an instrument to help human beings get through what pathei mathein means when war is on. 
The Iliad made Rupert Brook en route to Gallipoli joyous at the prospect of fighting gloriously on the very plains where Hector and Achilles met face to face—leaving out that Hector ran like hell trying to escape Achilles become a killing machine. At the outbreak of WW II, Simone Weill offered her radical interpretation of 'force' as the true hero of the Iliad. Classicist Kevin Herbert took the Iliad with him to Saipan where it served him well while he served, by his own choice, as a tail gunner in the bombing of Japan. Joseph Heller, besmitten with the Iliad since childhood, used it and Achilles as templates for Catch-22 and its central character Yossarian. And Anthony Swofford in Jarhead talks about reading the Iliad, but doesn't seem to draw any lessons from it applicable to his experiences in Operation Desert Storm.
Here we will look at ways in which the Iliad is used and misused, and some true problems key passages still pose to interpretation, by bonafide classical scholars (some labeled Homerists) and by others who would use the Iliad in translation as a tool for understanding what war is and does, for training soldiers and officers to fight, and for trying to heal the trauma war causes in human societies.

Most studies have emphasized its role situating Halikarnassos in the changing geopolitical landscape of the second century. But it is also an example of a Local Discourse Environment, in which different versions of Halikarnassian myth and history are deployed to champion the competing claims of Greeks and Karians. Comparison with other inscriptions from Halikarnassos underscores the continued existence of local groups, defined by ethnicity, familial affiliation, even neighbourhood, each vying with the other. The ‘Pride of Halikarnassos’ offers a more generous vision of Halikarnassos, recasting it as a place where these local rivalries may be reconciled.

EDT September 17,"Title: Nonparametric Causal Effects Based on Incremental Propensity Score Interventions

Abstract: Most work in causal inference considers deterministic interventions that set each unit’s treatment to some fixed value. However, under positivity violations these interventions can lead to nonidentification, inefficiency, and effects with little practical relevance. Further, corresponding effects in longitudinal studies are highly sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, resulting in widespread use of unrealistic parametric models. We propose a novel solution to these problems: incremental interventions that shift propensity score values rather than set treatments to fixed values. Incremental interventions have several crucial advantages. First, they avoid positivity assumptions entirely. Second, they require no parametric assumptions and yet still admit a simple characterization of longitudinal effects, independent of the number of timepoints. For example, they allow longitudinal effects to be visualized with a single curve instead of lists of coefficients. After characterizing incremental interventions and giving identifying conditions for corresponding effects, we also develop general efficiency theory, propose efficient nonparametric estimators that can attain fast convergence rates even when incorporating flexible machine learning, and propose a bootstrap-based confidence band and simultaneous test of no treatment effect. Finally, we explore finite-sample performance via simulation, and apply the methods to study time-varying sociological effects of incarceration on entry into marriage.", 4:30pm,,"701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104",Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB),,3:30pm ,,"Biostatistics Seminar Series - Edward Kennedy, PhD",http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710420,17-09-2019

EDT October 1,"Title: From dependent happenings to causal inference with interference
Abstract: Sir Ronald Ross developed a Theory of Happenings that distinguished independent from depending happenings. Dependent happenings are those in which the frequency of the happening depends on the number of individuals affected such as in most infectious diseases. Due to dependent happenings, interventions in infectious diseases can have several different kinds of effects. Demonstrating indirect effects of vaccination can have important consequences for public health policy. Causal inference using potential outcomes is an experimental paradigm to define estimands and estimators of causal effects of interventions. In infectious diseases, the potential outcome of an individual can depend on the treatment status of other individuals, called interference in causal inference. Defining causal estimands and estimators under interference is complicated. Here we present causal estimands and estimators of direct, indirect, total and overall effects of interventions under interference, with emphasis on vaccination in infectious diseases. We present these in both the two-stage randomized, one-stage randomized, and observational context.  We present examples of estimating these different effects for different vaccines using different approaches. We present recent trends in developing these methods that include using networks to allow for individual interference sets, for structured interference, and randomized experiments in large networks.

Abstract: Health care costs in the United States have continued to rise despite little meaningful improvement in health outcomes. A significant portion of these health care costs come from hospital spending. To help improve patient outcomes while reducing the cost of care, health care systems have put on a lot of effort into developing innovative interventions/treatments. Thus, determining target patients deemed likely to benefit from the innovative treatments is a key interest. In other words, we want to identify individualized treatment rules (ITRs) for targeted enrollment of patients. In this paper, we use the health care payments (which is a significant component to health care utilization) as our primary outcome. The problem is challenging such that health care payments often follow a mixture distribution with many patients incurring little to no payments over a given period of time and some patients incurring large costs: i.e. semi-continuous. We develop a general framework for estimation of ITRs based on a two-part modeling, where models are estimated for the zero part of the outcome and the positive part separately. To improve estimation performance in high dimensions, we leverage a scientifically-plausible penalty that encourages the signs of coefficients for each variable to agree between the two models. We also develop a highly efficient algorithm for computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in simulated examples and in a study of two treatment plans of complex case management in a major health system.", 4:30pm,,"701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104",Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB),,3:30pm ,,"Biostatistics Seminar Series - Guanhua Chen, PhD",http://events.med.upenn.edu/cceb/#!view/event/event_id/710427,08-10-2019

Abstract: An important practical problem in survival analysis is to predict the time to a future event. Available information in this scenario commonly includes longitudinal measurements from the same subject. Since future information is unknown and may develop dynamically over time, such a predictive problem is challenging. We consider a predictive approach based on modeling the forward intensity function. The forward intensity function approach is appealing for being capable of intrinsically incorporating the future dynamics that affect the stochastic event occurrence. To handle the practical difficulty due to the missing data in the longitudinal measurements, and to accommodate observations at irregularly spaced time points, we propose a smoothed composite likelihood approach for estimating the forward intensity model. Our theoretical analysis establishes the validity of the predictive modeling approach and the smoothed composite likelihood method. Extensive simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the promising performance of the predictive approach.

EDT October 29,"Title: Back to the Basics: Residuals and Diagnostics for Generalized Linear Models

Abstract: Ordinal outcomes are common in scientific research and everyday practice, and we often rely on regression models to make inference. A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this paper, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a “surrogate” of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual’s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to 1) mean structures; 2) link functions; 3) heteroscedasticity; 4) proportionality; and 5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness-of-fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are mis specified and advise how to make improvements.

Abstract: Multistate models provide a powerful framework for the analysis of life history
  processes when the goal is to characterize transition intensities, transition probabilities, state occupancy probabilities, and covariate effects thereon.  Data on such processes are often only available at random visit times occurring over a finite period.  We formulate a joint multistate model for the life history process, the recurrent visit process, and a random loss to follow-up time at which the visit process terminates.  This joint model is helpful when discussing the independence conditions necessary to justify the use of standard likelihoods involving the life history model alone and provides a basis for analyses that accommodate dependence.  We consider settings with disease-driven visits occur in combination with routinely scheduled visits and develop likelihoods that accommodate partial information on the types of visits.  Simulation studies suggest that suitably constructed joint models can yield consistent estimates of parameters of interest in the presence of dependent visit processes; identifiability and estimability. issues are also discussed. The biases from intermittent observation of time-dependent covariates will also be considered along with a multistate approach to mitigating this bias through joint modeling. Two applications will illustrate the benefits of joint modeling disease and observation processes.", 4:30pm,,"701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104",Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB),,3:30pm ,,"Biostatistics Seminar Series - Richard J.

"Thursday, October 17, 2019 - 12:00pm","While the US and China were starting the process of normalizing their relations in the early 1970s, the two Koreas engaged in their very first dialogue since the Korean War. Behind the façade of the peaceful talks, however, Seoul and Pyongyang were building up and modernizing their armed forces while militarizing their societies. Using declassified intelligence data and diplomatic documents from South Korea, the US, and former countries of the Eastern Bloc, I examine how and why inter-Korean military competition intensified during the détente period, culminating in the security crisis of 1976. Triggered by the Panmunjom axe murders, the stand-off was the Korean version of the Cuban missile crisis: the two Koreas narrowly but consciously avoided full-scale war; yet the arms race continued and persists to this day. This analysis serves as a case-study in the development of a cold war conflict and problematizes the notion of détente.",,,,Korean Studies,"Ria Chae

"Thursday, October 31, 2019 - 12:00pm","Based on ethnographic fieldwork, Minjeong Kimexamines Filipinas who married rural South Korean bachelors in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Against a backdrop of the South Korean government’s multicultural policies and projects aimed at integrating marriage im­migrants, Kimprovides a nuanced understanding of both the conflicts and emotional attachments of their relationships with marital families and communities. Her close-up accounts of the day-to-day operations of the state’s multicul­tural policies and public programs show inti­mate relationships between Filipinas, South Korean husbands, in-laws, and multicultural agents, and how various emotions of love, care, anxiety, and gratitude affect immigrant women’s fragmented citizenship and elusive sense of belonging to their new country.",,,,Korean Studies,"Minjeong Kim

"Thursday, December 5, 2019 - 12:00pm","This talk will examine the work of a largely forgotten Korean Buddhist laywoman, Court Lady Ch’ŏn Ilch’ŏng (1848 – 1934?), who served as one of the highest-ranking ladies in the court of the late Chosŏn dynasty. Ch’ŏn, driven by the vicissitudes of the times, did not remain confined as a mere servant of the Yi Royal Household but was an influential figure in Chosŏn politics and diplomacy. She further played a crucial role in modernizing Korean Buddhism during the pre-colonial and colonial era—equal in significance to the Korean Buddhist monastics with whom she worked. Despite her remarkable contributions toward modernizing the tradition, she is absent in the scholarship of Korean Buddhism. In this talk, I will draw on the known bits and pieces of information on Ch’ŏn to make a case that she played a seminal role in the incipient stage of modern Korean Buddhism. Ch’ŏn drew on a wide network of relationships both inside and outside the court to help establish the first modern institution of Korean Buddhism, build the first modern temple in central Seoul, and open the first modern Buddhist clinic in Korea. This article seeks to restore Ch’ŏn’s centrality as a Buddhist modernizer, thereby ultimately bringing balance to a largely monastic-centered and nationalist history and lengthening the lineage of lay female leadership in the transformation of Korean Buddhism in the beginning of the twentieth century.",,,,Korean Studies,"Hwansoo Kim

Sep 20 2019,"Existing theories of state strengthening focus on macro-level factors and assume away individual-level differences among politicians. But state strengthening has distributive consequences that impose more costs on some politicians than others. I provide a theoretical framework in which the geography of kinship network is correlated with politicians’ support for state strengthening. When politicians’ kin are geographically concentrated, they prefer a weak state because their kin can rely on low-cost private protection and evade taxes to the state. When politicians’ kin are geographically dispersed, they prefer to strengthen the state because it is more efficient to protect a large area using public protection. I construct an original dataset using politicians’ tomb epitaphs from eleventh-century China and show that even facing severe external threats politicians exhibited polarization in their attitudes toward state strengthening, which can be explained by the geography of their kinship networks.",1:00pm,,"CSCC Conference Room, Perelman 418, 133 S. 36th St.",Center for the Study of Contemporary China,"Yuhua Wang, Associate Professor of Government, Harvard University",12:00pm,,Elite Kinship Network and State Strengthening: Theory and Evidence from Imperial China,https://cscc.sas.upenn.edu//events/2019/09/20/elite-kinship-network-and-state-strengthening-theory-and-evidence-imperial-china,20-09-2019

Oct 10 2019,"Is the process of state building a unilateral, national venture, or is it something more collaborative, taking place in the interstices between adjoining countries? To answer this question, this book takes a comparative look at the state building process along China, Myanmar, and Thailand's common borderland area. It shows that the variations in state building among these neighboring countries are the result of an interactive process that occurs across national boundaries. Departing from existing approaches that look at such processes from the angle of singular, bounded territorial states, the book argues that a more fruitful method is to examine how state and nation building in one country can influence, and be influenced by, the same processes across borders. It argues that the success or failure of one country's state building is a process that extends beyond domestic factors such as war preparation, political institutions, and geographic and demographic variables. Rather, it shows that we should conceptualize state building as an interactive process heavily influenced by a ""neighborhood effect."" Furthermore, the book moves beyond the academic boundaries that divide arbitrarily China studies and Southeast Asian studies by providing an analysis that ties the state and nation building processes in China with those of Southeast Asia.
Enze Han is an Associate Professor at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong. His research interests include ethnic politics in China, China's relations with Southeast Asia, and the politics of state formation in the borderland area between China, Myanmar and Thailand.

Oct 26 2019,"Call for Papers
We invite all doctoral students who conduct research on China and international relations to submit papers or their abstracts to present at the fifth annual China and International Relations Graduate Research Workshop (CHAIR). The workshop will convene at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for the Study of Contemporary China (CSCC) on Saturday, October 26, 2019. CHAIR brings young IR scholars together to share their latest research related to China, build a professional network, and strengthen the academic community that focuses on China and IR topics. CHAIR is also the ideal venue for participants to present revised versions of papers from APSA’s summer 2019 meeting or rough drafts of papers for ISA’s spring 2020 convention. CSCC will reimburse participants up to $500 for accommodation and travel expenses. The bulk of our applications tends to come from the United States and Canada, but we are open to applicants from around the world (those traveling from beyond the US East Coast may be eligible for additional funding).
We are looking for approximately ten participants to present works that are part of their dissertations or that they intend to publish. Paper topics span the entire range of the IR sub-field, and abstracts will be chosen based on their level of development, fit with other submissions as part of a cohesive session, and representation of diverse perspectives, methodologies, and institutions. The day-long workshop will consist of four thematically-organized sessions, each comprised of 2-3 presenters and a discussant. Each presenter need only offer a brief overview of the paper (~5 minutes), to be followed by the discussant’s short, detailed comments on all the papers (~15 minutes). The majority of each session will be devoted to discussion open to all the participants. We expect all participants to have read the papers before the workshop, so that workshop discussions on the day can be as fruitful and productive as possible.
CHAIR offers an opportunity to build a community of young IR scholars who study China, and there will be ample time for socializing throughout the day. In addition to inter-session breaks, a catered lunch will be provided and, at the workshop’s conclusion, we will be pleased to host dinner at a local restaurant for further conversation in a more casual setting. CHAIR thus represents an excellent opportunity for academic enrichment and professional networking. To see past workshop participants and papers, please visit our Facebook page. We look forward to receiving your submissions.
Sincerely,
Rachel Hulvey, Clara Lee, and Alina Zheng

The CCD is a $23.5 million downtown management district, which provides security, cleaning, place marketing and planning services, as well as streetscape and park improvements for the central business district of Philadelphia.
Mr. Levy planned, received property owner and legislative approval for, and now directs the $23.5 million downtown management district, which provides security, cleaning, place marketing, and planning services, as well as streetscape and park improvements for the central business district of Philadelphia. Mr. Levy also oversaw property owner and legislative re-approval of the District in 1994 and 2004 enabling the CCD to finance and carry out capital improvements. To date, the CCD has completed over $43 million in streetscape, lighting, park and façade improvements.
Mr. Levy also serves as executive director of the Central Philadelphia Development Corp., (CPDC), an advocacy and planning organisation supported by the downtown business community. Among its recent initiatives are: advocacy and advertising efforts to increase the downtown residential population through the conversion of vacant office buildings to apartments; and business retention and recruitment focused on the commercial office sector.
Earlier in his career, as director, project development, for the University of Pennsylvania Department of Real Estate from 1984-1990, Mr. Levy served as project manager for the design and construction of mixed-use office and retail developments at 3401 Walnut Street, the PGH Health Center; and the 34th & Chestnut Street Garage. Mr. Levy also served at the Philadelphia Parking Authority (1982-1984), the Philadelphia Office of Housing and Community Development, (1980-1982) and the Institute for the Study of Civic Values (1976-1980).
Mr. Levy has an MA and PhD in history from Columbia University and an undergraduate degree in history from Lafayette College. He serves on the boards of many civic organisations, including the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau Executive Committee and the Independence Visitor Center Corporation. He is a past chairman of the International Downtown Association.
Since 1979, Mr. Levy has taught at the University of Pennsylvania in the City Planning Department directing graduate planning studios focused on Philadelphia and an introductory course on downtown development and management. Other teaching experience includes Temple University (1977-1984), Columbia University (1974-1976), Public School 155 Oceanhill-Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY (1971-1972) and Public School 186, Bronx, New York (1969-1970).
His many personal awards include the 2002 Wyck-Strickland Award for contributions to the cultural life of Philadelphia, the 2002 Philadelphia Committee on City Policy Community Leadership Award and the 1996 Pennsylvania Society of Architects Honor Award for contribution to an improved public environment by a non-architect.

"Thursday, March 26, 2020 - 5:30pm to 7:30pm","Event Information: Please join Fels for a conversation with Richard Cordray. Rich served for six years as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by a bipartisan vote of the Senate. Most recently, Rich was a candidate for Governor of Ohio in 2018.
During his tenure, the Consumer Bureau brought enforcement actions that returned over $12 billion to 30 million Americans. They created a consumer response system that gave people a voice; more than 1.3 million people had issues resolved by this means. And they adopted new rules to safeguard the multi-trillion-dollar mortgage market and prevent the kind of problems that led to the financial crisis of 2008 and the deep recession that followed.
Before joining the Consumer Bureau, Rich served as Ohio’s Attorney General, where he and his team recovered over $2 billion for Ohio’s retirees, investors, and business owners and took major steps to protect consumers from fraudulent foreclosures and financial predators. He also served as Ohio Treasurer, where he led the State’s banking, investment, debt, and financing activities. Rich previously taught at Ohio State’s law school and served as a State Representative and as Ohio’s first Solicitor General. He has argued seven cases before the US Supreme Court, including by special appointment of both the Clinton and Bush Justice Departments.
Rich is a graduate of Michigan State University’s James Madison College, Oxford University in England, and the University of Chicago Law School. He was Editor-in-Chief of the University of Chicago Law Review and later clerked for US Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy.

"Tuesday, September 17, 2019","Select a search area Join us for a Lunchtime Lecture by Daniel Jon Mitchell, research fellow and director of the Institute’s Center for Historical Research. For much of the 19th century, color photography was thought to be an impossibility. The announcement in February 1891 that the French experimental physicist Gabriel Lippmann had produced a colored image of an electromagnetic spectrum consequently generated widespread publicity. In the photographic press this ranged from incredulous dismissal to slavish triumphalism, which in France stemmed from patriotic traditions of photography and wave optics. Seeking a more balanced historical perspective on Lippmann’s achievement, Mitchell examines its reception in Britain. How did Lippmann succeed in convincing photographic chemists that his method was “physical” rather than chemical? Why was his spectral image perceived as such a decisive step toward full-color photography? How could the nature of his work be fixed even before it was viewed publicly in London? The answers to these questions open up the interfaces between science and visual art, theory and impression, and nationalism and internationalism at the fin de siècle.

"October 04, 2019","Over the 2019-2020 academic year, the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, will convene a regular works-in-progress series for scholars working in normative business ethics (NBE). In particular, the Series will workshop papers pursuing business ethics issues from a normative perspective, or papers in moral or political philosophy with implications for the market, distributive justice, labor relations, the role of business in society, etc.
Workshop Objectives
The Series is part of an effort to foster normative business ethics in the academy and the public sphere. This particular initiative has two key objectives: First, it endeavors to provide a regular forum for scholars working on business ethics from a normative perspective. The community of such scholars is relatively small and dispersed across numerous institutions, and there are few opportunities for these individuals to convene and share work. This Series is an effort to connect these scholars and to enrich their shared intellectual life. Second, the Series aims to be especially valuable to junior faculty and advanced graduate students, by providing them with feedback from, and opportunities to interact with, more established members of the normative business ethics community. To that end, we hope to have one junior author and one senior author at each session.
Workshop Format
The workshop will meet roughly once each month over the academic year. Any academic or practitioner with an interest in normative business ethics is invited to attend the sessions. Attendees are expected to read the papers in advance and to come with feedback for the paper authors. To maximize the opportunity for paper improvement, authors will not present their papers; we will instead spend our time together on questions and comments for the author.
Sessions will be held on Fridays, beginning at 1:00 pm unless otherwise indicated. We will discuss two to three papers at each session. Attendees are expected to read the papers in advance and to come prepared to offer feedback.

"October 10, 2019","Professor Daniel LaChance of Emory University will present on “Mrs. Miller’s Constitution: Civil Liberties and the Radical Right in Cold War America”


Abstract: In the early years of the Cold War, grassroots activists on the far-right end of the political spectrum became convinced that government bureaucracies were quietly ushering in an age of despotism. They grew especially alarmed at the growing power the government was giving to psychiatrists to oversee the psychological wellbeing of Americans. Using the state’s police powers, they feared, liberals would soon declare anti-communists and other conservatives mentally ill and banish them to mental institutions. Two events in the 1950s brought these anxieties to a fever pitch: the involuntary confinement of Vermont anti-communist activist Lucille Miller to a federal psychiatric hospital and federal legislation to fund the construction of a mental hospital in the Alaska territory.
  In their campaigns to free Miller and stop the construction of what they believed would be an Alaskan gulag, these activists turned to the law. They argued that the Constitution safeguarded a vision of liberty as the absence of unwanted government intrusions into an individual’s life. While these ultraconservative activists were dismissed as crackpots, many of their critics also felt a sense of diminished autonomy in the postwar world. In subsequent decades, they too would grow wary of government paternalism and embrace, for various reasons, a more libertarian understanding of rights. This idea of rights would eclipse an alternative vision of them as a tool for pursuing collective, egalitarian ends. To our growing body of explanations about how communitarian possibilities for civil rights and civil liberties were “lost” or “tamed” in the middle of the twentieth century, we might add anxieties about the fragility of the individual mind, which the cultural life of the Cold War drove to unprecedented levels.",1:20 PM,60767,Faculty Lounge,Penn Law School,,12:00 PM,,"Legal History Workshop: Daniel LaChance, Emory University",https://www.law.upenn.edu/newsevents/calendar.php#event_id/60767/view/event,10-10-2019

"March 28, 2019","Professor Shoemaker from University of Wisconsin Law School will present his paper “The Devil’s Justice”.


  Abstract: “Among the most underappreciated aspects of the devil’s medieval career is that he was once the lead plaintiff in the world’s most spectacularly ambitious lawsuit. He lost. He was defeated by the arguments of a woman, the Virgin Mary. The bitter defeat was amplified by the fact that the judge in the case was the very same person the devil had accused of violently despoiling him of the human souls whose ownership was in dispute. In hindsight, the loss might be what social scientists call overdetermined. The venue for the suit – heaven – and the day of the trial – Good Friday – were certainly not auspicious. Nonetheless, the devil initiated his lawsuit supremely confident that he would prevail. His confidence rested upon his belief that both the applicable laws and the overarching principles of justice were entirely on his side.


  It was that the lawsuit contained the “preposterous” image of a woman serving in the role of lawyer.  Perhaps worst of all, the outcome of the case did not turn solely on rational legal argumentation – the give and take of reasons and responses - but also, as we will see below, upon the tears of an emotionally overwrought woman. Serious scholars, he stressed, would not waste time with the text.

"November 15, 2018","Professor Anna Lvovsky will be presenting.


  Anna Lvovsky is an Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, where she teaches American legal history, the history of policing, criminal law, and evidence. Professor Lvovsky’s scholarship focuses on the legal and cultural dimensions of policing, judicial uses of professional knowledge, and the regulation of gender, sexuality, and morality. Her recent work examines judicial deference to police expertise and the role of moral judgment in the Supreme Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.


  Professor Lvovsky’s book project, Queer Expertise: Urban Policing and the Discovery of the Gay World, 1920-1970, under contract with the University of Chicago Press, examines how the police drew on a combination of scientific expertise and lay stereotype about homosexuality to shape the legal status of gay men in the United States. As a dissertation, the project received the 2016 Julien Mezey Dissertation Award from the Association for the Study of Law, Culture, and the Humanities.


  Prior to joining HLS, Professor Lvovsky was an Academic Fellow at Columbia Law School. She clerked for Judge Michael Boudin of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and for Judge Gerard E. Lynch of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Professor Lvovsky graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where she was articles co-chair of the Harvard Law Review and the recipient of the LGBTQ Writing Prize, and received her Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization from Harvard University.

"November 5, 2018","Professor Hirota’s current book project, “The Business of the Nation: Foreign Contract Labor and the Rise of American Immigration Control,” examines the transnational business of importing Asian, Canadian, European, and Mexican contract laborers to the United States and the evolution of federal alien contract labor law designed to restrict this form of immigration over the course of the long nineteenth century. Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers’ antipathy to “alien contract labor” resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.


   


  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) “pauper labor” discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.

"November 27, 2017","Between 1967 and 1979, the United States’ divorce rate doubled. The rapidly rising divorce rate created a widespread crisis among women who had relied on their husbands for economic support and access to social insurance benefits such as Social Security and health insurance. In reponse, a now-forgotten strand of the 1970s feminist movement, which I call “the feminist divorce reform movement,” emerged and organized itself around securing women’s place in the United States’ marriage-based insurance system. This paper, part of a larger project on this movement, examines divorce’s decreasing political salience as more and more women entered the permanent workforce. In the 1970s, one-third of married American women were in the paid labor force. By 1985 that number had shot up. Even women with young children were now as likely to be found in the workforce as at home: around 50 percent of mothers with children under three and roughly 70 percent of mothers with children over six were in the labor force. In response, feminists who had once focused on shoring up the marriage-based insurance system turned their efforts toward securing women’s place in the employment-based insurance system. In this paper I consider how legislative battles over the Family and Medical Leave Act, universal child care, and welfare reform fit into a longer history of feminist activism dedicated to creating a social insurance system that protected women from the economic vulnerabilities created by their carework obligations.

"October 11, 2017","Professor Elizabeth Papp Kamali, an Assistant Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, will be presenting her paper Trial by Ordeal by Jury in Medieval England, or Saints and Sinners in Literature and Law.


   


  Using a miracle tale as a focal point, this paper illuminates the political and cultural context of York at the turn of the twelfth to thirteenth century in order to make sense of England’s rapid transition from trial by ordeal to trial by jury after 1215. More specifically, the paper highlights the possible impact of the period of papal interdict (c. 1208 – 1214), imposed by Pope Innocent III in response to King John’s intransigence over the appointment of a new archbishop of Canterbury, during this transitional period in criminal procedure. It argues that the interdict, with its suspension of liturgies, might have forced experimentation with alternative means of reaching verdicts in felony cases. The paper also suggests that juries might have been involved in the issuance of ordeal verdicts in the late ordeal period in England, in which case the shift from trial by ordeal to trial by jury may be less a moment of rupture than a transition from one form of trial using juries to another, albeit a trial form more starkly desacralized after 1215. It is the author’s hope that the paper will serve as a starting point for further research, not a decisive answer to the questions it raises, including whether England’s rapid adoption of final jury verdicts may owe something to the tussle between King John and a particularly imperial and imperious pope.

,"Today’s massive elliptical galaxies are primarily red-and-dead, dispersion supported ellipticals. The physical process(es) driving the shutdown or “quenching” of star formation in these galaxies remains one of the least understood aspects of galaxy formation and evolution. Although today’s spiral and elliptical galaxies exhibit a clear bimodality in their structures, kinematics, and stellar populations, it may be that the quenching and structural transformation do no occur simultaneously. In this talk I will focus on results from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey of massive galaxies at z~0.8. I will show that early quiescent galaxies, observed much closer to their quenching epoch at z~1, retain significant rotational support (~twice as much as local ellipticals). This suggests that the mechanisms responsible for shutting down star formation do not also have to destroy ordered motion in massive galaxies; the increased dispersion support could occur subsequently via hierarchical growth and minor merging. Finally, I will discuss prospects for extending spatially resolved spectroscopic studies of galaxies immediately following quenching with JWST and eventually 30-m class telescopes.",,,,Penn Physics and Astronomy Department,,,,,https://www.physics.upenn.edu/events/astronomy-seminar-formation-massive-galaxies-deep-high-redshift-spectroscopy-lega-c-survey,
,"Living matter, such as biological tissue, can be seen as a nonequilibrium hierarchical assembly of assemblies of smaller and smaller active components, where energy is consumed at many scales. The functionality and versatility of such living or “active-matter” systems render it a promising candidate to study and to synthetically design. While many active-matter systems reside in fluids (solution, blood, ocean, air), so far, studies that include hydrodynamic interactions have focussed on microscopic scales in Stokes flows, where the active particles are <100μm and the Reynolds number, Re <<1. At those microscopic scales viscosity dominates and inertia can be neglected. However, what happens as swimmers slightly increase in size (say ~0.1mm-100cm) or as they form larger aggregates and swarms? The system then enters the intermediate Reynolds regime where both inertia and viscosity play a role, and where nonlinearities in the fluid are introduced. In this talk, I will present a simple model swimmer used to understand the transition from Stokes to intermediate Reynolds numbers, first for a single swimmer, then for pairwise interactions and finally for collective behavior. We show that, even for a simple model, inertia can induce hydrodynamic interactions that generate novel phase behavior, steady states and transitions.",,,,Penn Physics and Astronomy Department,,,,,https://www.physics.upenn.edu/events/condensed-and-living-matter-seminar-touch-non-linearity-mesoscale-swimmers-and-active-matter,

,We usually design materials to target desired behaviors that are defined in a top-down manner. Learning theory offers an alternative when desired behaviors are hard to define but easy to give examples of. We consider materials that change as they physically experiences training examples and then test the material on novel inputs never seen before (generalization).  We study the physical requirements for such information processing using theory and experiments in two systems: thin sheets that can be trained in a supervised manner to classify high dimensional force patterns and self-assembling DNA strands that can classify high dimensional patterns in chemical concentrations.,,,,Penn Physics and Astronomy Department,,,,,https://www.physics.upenn.edu/events/condensed-and-living-matter-seminar-materials-learn-examples,
,"Fertilization is one of the fundamental processes of living systems. Here I will address marine external fertilization and comment on recent work on mammals. I will show experiments that substantiate that sea urchin sperms exhibit chemotaxis as they swim towards the ovum. They are guided by flagellum internal [Ca2+] concentration fluctuations triggered by the binding of chemicals from the oocyte surroundings. Based on experiment, I present a family of logical regulatory networks for the [Ca2+] fluctuation signaling-pathway that reproduce previously observed electrophysiological behaviors and provide predictions, which have been confirmed with new experiments. These studies give insight on the operation of drugs that control sperm navigation. In this systems biology approach, global properties of the [Ca2+] discrete regulatory network dynamics such as: stability, redundancy, degeneracy, chaoticity and criticality can be determined. Our models operate near a critical dynamical regime, where robustness and evolvablity coexist. This regime is preserved under a class of strong perturbations. Based on global dynamics considerations, we have implemented a network node-reduction method. The coincidence of this reduced network with our bottom-up step-by-step, continuous differential equation modeling is reassuring. For the case of mammals our research has centered on the understanding of capacitation and acrosomal reaction. The first is a process by means of which roughly one third of the spermatozoa acquire the “capacity” to fertilize; the second enables the spermatozoa to penetrate the egg´s surrounding zona pellucida. Overall, our studies might contribute to fertility issues such as the development of male contraception treatments, which is an area of intense research.",,,,Penn Physics and Astronomy Department,,,,,https://www.physics.upenn.edu/events/mathematical-biology-seminar-fertilization-regulatory-networks,

"Wednesday, 22 October 2014 - 5:00pm—6:30pm","Religion, power, and science, as well as craft and fashion intertwine in this fascinating account by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Roald Hoffmann of the use and influence of indigo in world cultures. The vast journey of blue moves from Hebrew ritual uses of snail pigments to the chemistry and economics of blue jean dyes.
American chemist Roald Hoffmann is widely known for using quantum mechanics to help reveal the mechanisms of chemical reactions. He was born Roald Safran in 1937 in a small Polish town that is now part of the Ukraine. Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called ""Entertaining Science"" at Cornelia Street Café in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended Hückel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).",6:30pm,,"Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street",Wolf Humanities Center Events,,5:00pm,,The Allure of Indigo,http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/allure-indigo,22-10-2014
"Saturday, 1 November 2014—Saturday, 20 December 2014","The exhibition examines how artists have engaged with ideas of homeland and belonging that fail to cohere to a unitary sense of time or place. Through film, photography and performance, the artists in this exhibition explore the contours of belonging across different contexts - from the invention of nationalist social rituals to the homecoming of veterans, from the trope of the ""haunted"" house to that of the family portrait. By bringing together the work of an international group of artists approaching home as a volatile concept, this exhibition examines how fantasies of belonging involve complex psychic and affective responses to specific material and historical conditions informed by race, gender, sexuality and class.""Itinerant Belongings"" grounds this inquiry by revisiting critical debates that bridged activism and art in the 1980s and 1990s. Responding to the presence of the homeless, the displaced, and the disenfranchised in American cities, two of the artists in the exhibition, William Pope.L and Krzysztof Wodiczko, produced projects in this critical moment that questioned the very notion of what it meant for a space to be ""public."" This exhibition aims to reanimate this dialogue and extend it to a contemporary global landscape marked by mass displacement, armed conflict, and debates around borders and immigration.Work by Yael Bartana, Jamie Diamond, Andrew Moore, William Pope.L, Paul Salveson, Jessica Vaughn, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Krzysztof Wodiczko will be on display at Slought and the Addams Gallery at PennDesign, and viewers are encouraged to take an itinerant path from one exhibition site to another.

Anthropologist and paleobiologist Nina Jablonski discusses her groundbreaking research on the physical evolution of skin color in humans and how its meanings, associations, and values have changed over time.
Nina G. Jablonski is a biological anthropologist and paleobiologist who studies the evolution of adaptations to the environment in Old World primates including humans. Her work is focused in two major areas. Her paleoanthropological research concerns the evolutionary history of Old World monkeys, and currently includes an active field project in China. Her research on the evolution of human adaptations to the environment centers on how human skin and skin pigmentation have evolved over time, and includes an active field project examining the relation between skin pigmentation and vitamin D production.Professor Jablonski is currently collaborating on the development of new approaches to science education in the United States. These approaches have the dual aims of improving the understanding of evolution and human diversity, and of stimulating interest among students in pursuing STEM courses and careers. With the support of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) and active collaboration of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., she is leading a group of 30 scholars in the development of ""genetics and genealogy"" curricula for K-12 and college undergraduate students.She also leads a major new scholarly effort to study the effects of race in South African society. With the support of the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study, she is the convener of the ""Effects of Race"" program, in which a select group of scholars assemble annually to formulate new ways to study race and to mitigate racial discrimination.",7:00pm,,"Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street",Wolf Humanities Center Events,,5:00pm,,The Colors of Human Skin,http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/colors-human-skin,19-11-2014
"Wednesday, 10 December 2014 - 5:00pm—6:30pm","The brilliant colors of butterfly wings reveal much about aesthetics, evolution, and engineering. How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.
Using holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.
In 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation. And in 2011, she was selected by the National Academy of Engineering to present at the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. In addition to being widely published, Dr. Yang holds over 20 patents, issued or pending.

In Costa Rica, he serves as technical advisor to Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG), a 165,000 hectare government/private hybrid conservation area. He is also president of the Guanacaste Dry Forest Conservation Fund (GDFCF), the US-based NGO for ACG.
He and his wife, Winnie Hallwachs, are currently working to further the CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) and iBOL (International Barcode of Life) efforts to DNA barcode all species of the world for their identification and species discovery by anyone anywhere at any time. Janzen is also an international authority on the taxonomy and biology of tropical caterpillars, and is a member of the US and the Costa Rican National Academy of Sciences, and recipient of the Crafoord Prize (1984), the Kyoto Prize (1997), and BBVA Prize (2012).
John Tresch is an historian of science and technology. Trained in anthropology and philosophy, his work explores the diversity of the sciences, especially in their interactions with other cultural formations. He focuses on connections between cosmology, experience, social order, and ritual; changing methods, instruments, and disciplinary arrangements in the sciences, arts, and media; and shifting definitions of the rational and real.
His book The Romantic Machine, which is set in France before the revolution of 1848, examines intersections between romanticism, science, industry, and utopian politics. It won the 2013 History of Science Society's Pfizer Award for Outstanding Book and was named one of the Best Books of 2012 by The New Museum in New York. His forthcoming book, Poe's Machinery: Twisted Visions, Incredible Facts, and the Forging of US Science, shows Edgar Allan Poe's technical obsessions in the light of the efforts of scientists to institute authority over knowledge. Tresch is also working on the study of cosmograms as a tool for comparative cosmology, notably in the Anthropocene and the digital age; as well as a study of contemporary neuroscience in its encounters with contemplative practices.

Muralists Betsy Casañas and Ernel Martinez join Mural Arts Program founder and director Jane Golden in this conversation on culture, community building, and arts education. Moderated by Penn urban design professor Amy Hillier, the event will feature site-specific mural projects from around the city.Jane Golden, as the driving force behind the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, is a true agent of social change, a Philadelphia phenom. Conceived as an anti-graffiti program in 1984, the Mural Arts Program has under Golden's leadership produced over 3600 landmark works of public art in nearly every neighborhood throughout the city. What do these murals embody? So much—about what transforms places, people, communities, and institutions. Read the program's mission statement: ""We believe art ignites change."" Live its golden rule: ""When we create art with each other and for each other, the force of life can triumph."" And celebrate its ""Palette of Core Values."" Do these things, and you will know why Jane Golden has been honored with so many awards, among them the Philadelphia Award, the Hepburn Medal, the 2012 Governor's Award for Innovation in the Arts, and the Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania Award.Betsy Casañas is a studio and public mural artist, a community activist, and an educator who was born and raised in the heart of ""The Badlands"" of North Philadelphia's barrio. She received her BFA from Moore College of Art and Design, and has worked in the Latino community since 1994. Casañas has exhibited her work in various solo and group exhibits and has designed over 40 public murals and mosaics nationally and internationally. In 2007 she cofounded The Semilla Arts, a grassroots initiative that uses collaborative art as a means of empowering people and communities in underserved areas. In 2010 she opened ""A Seed of Diamond Gallery,"" a community space where artists of different cultural background gather to tell their stories through spoken word, music, and visual arts.Ernel Martinez was inspired to become a mural artist while a PennDesign student in Jane Golden's class on public art at the University of Pennsylvania, where one of his mentors was Terry Adkins. Martinez received his MFA from Penn in 2004 and has since worked on over 25 murals across Philadelphia, including A Place to Call Home, The Color of Your Voice.Amy Hillier holds joint faculty appointments in Penn's School of Design and School of Social Policy and Practice, where she teaches and studies the impact of the built environment on public health and welfare—in particular, the impact to disadvantaged communities of more limited access to services and resources. Her research spans such topics as food, physical activity, and obsesity; outdoor advertising; and historical mapping projects. She is, for example, currently directing a public history project to map race and class in the W.E.B. DuBois Seventh Ward of Philadelphia.

"Friday, 20 February 2015 - 10:00am—5:00pm","This symposium is an opportunity to prompt conversations among artists and academics across multiple disciplines on the history of political, economic and aesthetic values attached to color. Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color—how we evoke color with and/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt? To what degree is color a 'natural' or physical property and in what ways is it a rhetorical or cultural construction? And, how do institutions assign value to color?

"Wednesday, 25 February 2015 - 5:00pm—6:30pm","Imagine a world of magenta Tuesdays, wavy green symphonies, tastes that have shapes, and words that have taste. Called synesthesia, this human perceptual condition in which information between the senses is blended has long fascinated scientists and laypeople alike. Award-winning neuroscientist and New York Times bestselling author David Eagleman presents new findings from his research into the behavioral, neurological, and genetic characteristics of synesthetes.
There are an infinite number of boring things to do in science. But we live these short life spans. Why not do the thing that's the coolest thing in the world to do? —David Eagleman, The New Yorker

David Eagleman is best known for his work on time perception, synesthesia, and neurolaw. He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.
In 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.
One of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada). Also in Fall 2015, Eagleman will host the new PBS science series, ""The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman.""
From the Eagleman Laboratory website, in his own words:""Public understanding of science is a passion of mine, and to that end I have written for the New York Times, Discover Magazine, Atlantic, The Week, Slate, Wired, New Scientist, and others. I speak often on National Public Radio and BBC to discuss what's new and important in science. I have founded a prize in mathematics and physics.""I am fortunate to be a Guggenheim Fellow. Within the scientific community, I serve as an editor for Journal of Vision, PLoS One, and Seminars in Brain and Consciousness. I also serve on the board of directors for several organizations, including The Long Now Foundation.""My book of fiction, Sum, was lucky enough to become an international bestseller. It has been translated into 27 languages and was named a Best Book of the Year by Barnes and Noble, New Scientist, and the Chicago Tribune. British musician Brian Eno and I performed a musical reading of Sum at the Sydney Opera House, and German composer Max Richter translated Sum into a full opera at the Royal Opera House in London.""My neuroscience book Incognito became a New York Times bestseller, and was named a Book of the Year by Amazon, Goodreads, Houston Chronicle, and Boston Globe. No one is writing an opera for that one yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.""",6:30pm,,"Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street",Wolf Humanities Center Events,,5:00pm,,The Kaledioscopic Brain of Synesthesia,http://wolfhumanities.upenn.edu/events/kaledioscopic-brain-synesthesia,25-02-2015

Eric Wubbels, composer, pianist, and Executive Director of the Wet Ink Ensemble
Structural Uses of Microtonality and Just-Intonation in Recent Works for Strings and Piano

The increasing facility of new music string players with just-intonation (the tuning of intervals according to harmonic series relationships) offers access not only to vivid new worlds of sonority and harmonic complexity, but also to new possibilities in the integration or co-composition of harmony and timbre. When combined with the fixed, tempered intonation of the piano, just sonorities both maintain their internal timbral stability while creating strong acoustic beating at speeds precise enough that they can be used as rhythmic and temporal structures in the piece. This allows for a reimagining of consonance and dissonance as a fluid spectrum of speeds and intensities of acoustic beating. These concepts will be explored with reference to several recent works written for violinist Josh Modney and cellist Mariel Roberts, including if and only if (2019), gretchen am spinnrade (2016), being-time (2013-15), and ""the children of fire come looking for fire"" (2012).

Please join us the following evening on Wednesday, September 18 at University Lutheran to see the debut program If And Only If featuring Eric Wubbels with Josh Modney and Mariel Roberts, presented by Bowerbird.

For at least 20 years, scholars, critics, and music fans have taken note of the affective power of Caetano Veloso's recording of ""CucurrucucúPaloma"" in international queer cinema. The creative choices that have gone into featuring the song in key moments of emotional gravitas on stage and screen latch onto fragments of the song’s extended meaning in audiovisual media, whether it be in homage or as a sendup of masculinity. Prior to Veloso’s performance of it, “Cucurrucucú Paloma” had an extended life incomédias rancheras, a style of musical film from the “Golden Age” of Mexican Cinema, where it was often performed by women. This presentation traces the meanings and affective content of the song’s prominence in queer screen media and performance, focusing in particular onMoonlight(2016) and the performed repertoire of Fado Bicha, an influential queer fado duo from Lisbon. It argues that when the song appears, the artists in question are latching onto fragments of the song’s extended meaning in audiovisual media, especially as regards Veloso’s vocal timbre and changes in the song’s arrangement. Contextualizing this musical choice allows us further insight into how a seemingly obscure musical cue can deepen the meaning of performance for knowledgeable publics.

About Night Music Chamber Ensemble
Night Music Chamber Ensemble is a Philadelphia-based chamber ensemble dedicated to exploring and performing music of the Revolutionary era, roughly 1760 to 1825. Our repertory ranges from duos and trios to large-scale chamber works combining strings and winds, such as the imaginative symphony arrangements that were so popular around 1800, to concertos, cantatas, and concert arias. We've just finished presenting our third concert season in Philadelphia, with guest appearances on the inaugural PhilaLandmarks Early Music Concert Series and the Early Music at St. James series in Lancaster.

Our musicians are among the country's leading players specializing in historically-informed performance. They perform with and hold leadership positions in many prominent period-instrument ensembles, including Philadelphia's Tempesta di Mare, Bach Collegium, and Franklin Quartet, and, farther afield, the Boston Early Music Festival Orchestra, the Handel & Haydn Society, Trinity Baroque Orchestra, Kleine Kammermusik, NYS Baroque, and the Washington Bach Consort.

Bowerbird, the University of Pennsylvania Department of Music, and the Annenberg Center are pleased to present Zeitgeist: George Crumb at 90, a three concert festival celebrating more than seventy years of music by Grammy and Pulitzer Prize winning composer George Crumb. Crumb’s music often juxtaposes contrasting musical styles, ranging from music of the western art-music tradition, to hymns and folk music, to non-Western musics. Many of Crumb’s works include programmatic, symbolic, mystical and theatrical elements, which are often reflected in his beautiful and meticulously notated scores. A shy, yet warmly eloquent personality, Crumb retired from his teaching position at the University of Pennsylvania after more than thirty years of service. Honored by numerous institutions with honorary Doctorates, and the recipient of dozens of awards and prizes, Crumb makes his home just outside of Philadelphia, in the same house where he and his wife of more than sixty years raised their three children.

"October 11, 2019 - 3:00pm - October 12, 2019 - 8:00pm","Racial ideology is baked into the cultural and music history of early America. Native peoples and colonists heard each other’s music as indicators of difference, friendliness, or danger. The regulation of song and dance was integral to the subjugation of enslaved people. And, in the United States, a vested interest in forming a nation of white citizens was underpinned by pious and genteel repertoire. This workshop seeks to provide a space for the cultivation of new areas of inquiry into the intersection of race, music, and American cultural history. While the interrelated relationship between race, modernity, and American music is of enduring interest to scholars–especially those focused on the twentieth century to today–this workshop is dedicated to tracing these long-term themes in the earlier period from colonial encounter to the Civil War.

This workshop will feature papers from scholars at all career stages using a wide variety of sources, including archival and/or ethnographic work, material artifacts like historical instruments, sheet music, theatrical ephemera, photography, journals, and all forms of print media. Participants will be asked to pre-circulate their 20-page paper and respond to another presenter’s work in this intensive two-day workshop. Bonnie Gordon (University of Virginia) is scheduled to kick off the event for participants with a paper on Friday. Support for travel and lodging will be provided for accepted participants.

Questions may be directed to organizers Glenda Goodman and Rhae Lynn Barnes: EarlyAmericanMusicAndRace@Gmail.com

All papers will be pre-circulated to those who register for the workshop. Saturday’s discussions will entail a 5-10 minute response followed by a discussion of the paper.

These five artists and collectives find ways to negotiate power and assert presence by defying dominant media narratives in China, India, Nicaragua, and beyond. While memes can and do wreak havoc in our societies, notably on our electoral processes, we invite you to consider a broader definition of memetic expression that includes the promotion of civic good and social equity through visual, haptic, and interactive discourse. Here, artists find creative ways to amplify, build on, and disseminate messages from underheard social movements.

About the Talk
Spies have made a remarkable international comeback in popular film and TV since the early 2010s. Many of the recent TV series and feature films that revolve around spying and surveillance also draw on the Cold War for historical parallels, antecedents, or representational elements to convey a decidedly contemporary sense of ambiguity, allegory, and dystopia that is associated with the global crisis of neo-liberal markets, the erosion of trust in democratic institutions, and the emergence of autocratic leaders worldwide.
Imre probes this association further and asks why and how the memory of the Cold War is resurrected through its favored genre to lend a representative platform to current, globally shared structures of feeling. On the one hand, the implied historical parallels yield a contemporary reevaluation of the Cold War as much more complex and more thoroughly networked among national and other agents than the triumphant Western narrative of two warring empires has long suggested. On the other hand, the comparison between Cold War and contemporary manifestations of spies and spying guide us to understand significant recent transformations in the nature, effects, and experience of surveillance. This transformation involves the global political and affective impact of populism and authoritarianism; stark economic inequality; widespread digital state and corporate surveillance; a conservative backlash against women, minorities, and immigrants; the erosion of democratic institutions; the appearance of fake news delivered by algorithms; and Russia’s return to the international stage as powerful state with imperial ambitions, headed by a former KGB agent.
Equally important, the comparison between Cold War and contemporary spies highlights a radical transformation of the technological and media networks themselves from nation-based broadcast networks to streaming platforms that are themselves active facilitators of a more widespread, insidious, and inescapable sense of surveillance. In particular, Imre argue that there is a synergy between the structures of broadcast television and Cold War representations of spying on the one side and contemporary, digital, SVOD delivery and the structures of spying represented by streaming services on the other. This feedback loop between spying as content and technology compels a serious critical and historical understanding and requires creative pedagogies of interruption.

Fracking is one of today’s most consequential and contentious land uses. As energy analysts note, the frenetic pace and vast scale of the fracking boom constitutes an “energy revolution” that is transforming geopolitics and the world economy. Yet the “big picture” overlooks how personal fracking is. The U.S. is the only country in the world where private property rights extend to all subsurface minerals; the fracking boom depends on the millions of people residing over shale deposits privately agreeing to lease their land’s subsurface mineral rights to petroleum companies. This means that this momentous and far-reaching decision about the planet—to frack or not to frack—is largely a series of individual choices rather than the result of collective deliberation. Many of the spillover effects of fracking are felt close to home: one’s decision to lease may impact neighbors’ air, water, or property. While resource dilemmas are usually experienced in the abstract (e.g., lab simulations, or considering future generations), shale communities must confront the conflict between self-interest and the commonwealth at the fencepost, the general store, and town halls. Based on ethnographic research in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, Jerolmack will discuss how, on the one hand, support for land leasing and fracking cannot be reduced to self-interest and how, on the other hand, the legally protected freedom to exploit one’s mineral rights had the ironic effect of eroding the freedom of others--their right to be left alone, and their sovereignty over their estate. These findings offer lessons for overcoming the greatest collective action problem of all: climate change.

From temporary day laborers to high paid consultants, however, the fleeting nature of modern work is not simply the result of technological innovations but are rather the product of shifting strategies and structures of management, capital, and culture. This conversation will explore the historical transformation of American corporations as well as the advent of new forms of digital labor, algorithmic management, and platforms. Is the economy being “Uberized”? Who is jumping ahead? Who is being left behind? What are the roles of data and digital technologies in these changes? By recapturing the human sides of these transformations of work — the managers, the workers, and the platform builders — we can better understand the forces shaping the ways we work today. And we might also be empowered to remake the ways we work in the future.

National sovereignty has been at the heart of debates in global communication studies since the development of propaganda studies to understand Nazi strategic communication nearly 80 years ago. Preoccupations over the nation-state, sovereignty, and national cultural identity have haunted successive paradigms: from early development communication to media imperialism scholars who attacked Western domination to globalization theorists who celebrated or criticized the crumbling of national boundaries. Digitization has brought a host of new challenges that have made sovereignty a fraught and complex issue in the age of social media platforms, cloud computing, drone technology, and mobile devices. How should we reconceive sovereignty in this context? Who or what is sovereign today? How has the exercise of sovereignty changed? And what is it to be subject to these new practices of sovereignty? CARGC is hosting a one-day workshop on October 3, 2019 to focus on the transformation and theorization of sovereignty in the digital age.

What are the practical implications of an AI-enabled world? As we think about the possibilities for digital campuses, corporations and communities in the future, it is important to keep in mind the limits of technology in solving social problems. Despite the optimistic promises of digital evangelists, it has become clear that most large-scale software systems exacerbate existing social inequality. 
In this talk, author and professor Meredith Broussard looks at the inner workings and outer limits of technology, and explains why we should never assume that computers always get things right. Making a case against “technochauvinism” — the belief that technology is always the solution — Broussard looks at why self-driving cars don’t really work and why social problems persist in every digital Utopia. If we understand the limits of what we *can* do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we *should* do with it to make the world better for everyone.

17 Oct 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm,"About the Book
Brand warfare is real. Guerrilla Marketing details the Colombian government’s efforts to transform Marxist guerrilla fighters in the FARC into consumer citizens. Alexander L. Fattal shows how the market has become one of the principal grounds on which counterinsurgency warfare is waged and postconflict futures are imagined in Colombia. This layered case study illuminates a larger phenomenon: the convergence of marketing and militarism in the twenty-first century. Taking a global view of information warfare, Guerrilla Marketing combines archival research and extensive fieldwork not just with the Colombian Ministry of Defense and former rebel communities, but also with political exiles in Sweden and peace negotiators in Havana. Throughout, Fattal deftly intertwines insights into the modern surveillance state, peace and conflict studies, and humanitarian interventions, on one hand, with critical engagements with marketing, consumer culture, and late capitalism on the other. The result is a powerful analysis of the intersection of conflict and consumerism in a world where governance is increasingly structured by brand ideology and wars sold as humanitarian interventions.
 
Full of rich, unforgettable ethnographic stories, Guerrilla Marketing is a stunning and troubling analysis of the mediation of global conflict.

New Yorker

""A sobering book on how armies burnish their brands. . . a detailed, eye-opening investigation.""



 
ReVista

""Guerrilla Marketing is a fascinating book that illustrates how the government’s turn to marketing blurred the boundaries between war and peace by penetrating deep into the emotional space of insurgents and their families. It is a well-written account that intersperses analytic chapters with the author’s riveting interviews with FARC insurgents, which offer a view into how the rebels understand what has happened to themand sidesteps PAHD propaganda. The book should be read by anyone trying to understand contemporary Colombian society.""
 



Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life

“Guerrilla Marketing is a fascinating examination of how commercial-style branding has been deployed by both rebels and the state in Colombia's civil war. Fattal deserves high praise for his extraordinary research, carried out over many years in the edgy and borderless terrain of the war's periphery. His insights are lucid and the stories he tells are haunting. This book is a must-read for scholars of modern conflict, journalists, and diplomats.”

Democracies are currently under siege, as fake news are flooding social media and post-truth sentiments roam throughout society. This dystopian narrative has come to dominate political agendas across the globe. To save democracy — a number of voices argue — radical measures are needed. In this talk, Johan Farkas critically examines post-truth discourses, honing in on both the contemporary threats posed by disguised propaganda on social media and the risks of advancing undemocratic solutions to solve them.
The first part of the talk dives into the rise and proliferation of disguised propaganda on social media, drawing on empirical cases such as the Internet Research Agency in Russia and fake Muslim Facebook pages in Denmark. While disguised propaganda is not a new phenomenon in itself, the technological architecture of digital platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, enables new forms of manipulation, tactically exploiting interfaces, algorithmic proliferation, and content moderation policies. This poses novel challenges for democracy.
Disguised propaganda in digital media have caused scholars, journalists, and politicians to talk about a post-truth crisis in dire need of fixing. Indeed, for many, truth must be restored at all costs, as democracy is founded on evidence-based decision-making. The second part of the talk critically engages with these post-truth discourses and the solutions they contain. Engaging with critical political philosophy, Farkas highlights how these ""democratic imaginaries"" neglect how democracy has never been about truth, evidence and rationality alone. It is equally about the voice of the democratic people. By neglecting this cornerstone of the democratic tradition, post-truth discourses reproduce and strengthen a risky vision of democracy — one in which consensus and rationality dominate over civic voices and popular dispute. By doing so, contemporary post-truth discourses — and the solutions they contain — might end up deepening existing democratic problems.
The talk is based on Farkas’ new book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood, written with Jannick Schou and published by Routledge.
About the Speaker
Johan Farkas is a Ph.D. Fellow in Media and Communication Studies at Malmö University in Sweden. His research engages with the intersection of digital media platforms, disinformation, politics, journalism, and democracy. Farkas has published on these topics in international journals such as New Media & Society, Social Media + Society, and Critical Discourse Studies. In September 2019, his debut book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood (with Jannick Schou) was published by Routledge. The book presents a detailed analysis of contemporary discourses of fake news and post-truth, offering both a trenchant critique and call for more inclusive forms of democracy.

,"Join us as we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the making of NO! The Rape Documentary and the 2019 publication of the anthology Love WITH Accountability: Digging Up the Roots of Child Sexual Abuse and host a national, intergenerational forum to co-envision a society without violence.
There isn’t a more significant time to lift the courageous, intergenerational, diasporic Black voices in NO! The Rape Documentary and Love WITH Accountability: Digging Up the Roots of Child Sexual Abuse anthology than now. Fall 2019 will mark both the 25th anniversary of the first pre-production meeting for the internationally acclaimed documentary film and the forthcoming publication of the anthology. Each of these works are groundbreaking, prevention resources that unwaveringly center diasporic Black survivors of adult rape and child sexual abuse. To commemorate the convergence of these milestones, Aishah Shahidah Simmons, the award-winning director of the film, and the editor of the anthology, is partnering with the University of Pennsylvania, the Just Beginnings Collaborative, Feminist and Gender Studies Department at Colorado College, Scribe Video Center, and the African American Museum of Philadelphia, to host #FromNO2Love: Black Feminist Centered Forum on Disrupting Sexual Violence in Philadelphia on October 31 & November 1. This gathering will lift the long-term and new survivor-led work that addresses, disrupts, and works to humanely end child sexual abuse and adult rape in marginalized communities.

The course, The Ethics of Forgetting, was taught by Jessa Lingel (Annenberg School for Communication) and Annette Markam (Aarhus University).
Digital information is continually being created and circulated, but it is also forgotten, deleted and otherwise lost. Whether from the perspective of journalists, activists, artists or academics, how do we deal with the deletion or loss of media? Where is information archived and what politics guide its organization, curation and erasure? Where do our media live and die? This course began with theories of institutional and individual archiving. It then moved to concepts of remediation and machine learning  to complicate how information travels, data is stored and archives are 'retrieved'. Finally, using case studies of arts-based digital archiving projects, the course focused on the politics of forgetting media.",1:30pm,,"Location: Annenberg School, Room 500",Annenberg School of Communication,,12:00pm,,Center for Media at Risk: SummerCulture Colloquium,https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/events/center-media-risk-summerculture-colloquium-0,06-11-2019
07 Nov 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm,"About the Talk
This presentation proposes that a key but often overlooked dimension of media infrastructure are those relationalities that remain incommunicado by design. If infrastructure conditions how information, people, and things circulate, then what might the practices of concealment tell us about the political stakes of circulation, and about the nature of our infrastructural surround? What kinds of visual forms emerge in global media events in which concealment is crucial part, sometimes even the condition of possibility for targetable people and equipment to stay on air. This colloquium examines these contradictions in the context of Lebanon, where infrastructural disrepair and breakdown parallel political impasses and fragmentation. It takes the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year as its case study. Based on fieldwork and visual analysis, El-Hibri examines how concealment structures phenomena ranging from live satellite news broadcasts, drone-cam footage, signal jamming and hacking, and online guerilla video from the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year. He shows how televisual liveness in this event — that new-again promise to see things faraway as they happen — demonstrates how the geopolitics of simultaneity has transformed in the contemporary moment.
About the Speaker

11 Nov 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm,"About the Book
Is there a link between the colonization of Palestinian lands and the enclosing of Palestinian minds? In his book, The Palestinian Idea, Greg Burris argues that it is precisely through film and media that hope can occasionally emerge amidst hopelessness, emancipation amidst oppression, freedom amidst apartheid. The author employs the work of Edward W. Said, Jacques Rancière, and Cedric J. Robinson in order to locate Palestinian utopia in the heart of the Zionist present. He analyzes the films of prominent directors Annemarie Jacir (Salt of This Sea, When I Saw You) and Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now) to investigate the emergence and formation of Palestinian identity. Looking at Mais Darwazah’s documentary My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, Burris considers the counterhistories that make up the Palestinian experience—stories and memories that have otherwise been obscured or denied. He also examines Palestinian (in)visibility in the global media landscape, and how issues of Black-Palestinian transnational solidarity are illustrated through social media, staged news spectacles, and hip hop music. 
""A deeply felt, brilliantly conceived, meticulously crafted book, The Palestinian Idea breaks new ground in how we understand vision, space, and identity. Greg Burris's work is an important contribution to Arab and global media studies."" —Marwan M. Kraidy, Anthony Shadid Chair in Global Media, Politics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Naked Blogger of Cairo: Creative Insurgency in the Arab World 
 ""Greg Burris has written the book so many people have been waiting for—and he's done it in sharp and readable prose. Situating Palestine in relation to various global revolutionary movements and animating Palestine's own revolutionary identity, Burris has managed the rare feat of producing scholarship that is both timeless and topical. By so thoroughly and imaginatively exploring the idea of Palestine, he illuminates exactly how real Palestine is."" —Steven Salaita, author of Israel's Dead Soul

This presentation examines how we might begin to apprehend the everyday presence of television in South Indian media life through a focus on the material object of the television set and its material entanglements. Through a consideration of the television set’s intertwining with devices ranging from VCRs to set-top boxes and optical-fiber cables, Chirumamilla exposes new veins of analysis through which we might understand both the inter-media history within which television in South India is embedded and the kinds of mediated futures that television’s material transformations portend.
 
Following an overview of her larger project, which utilizes both ethnographic research and close textual analysis of newspapers, enthusiast magazines, and policy documents, Chirumamilla will turn her focus to the objects of the television set, the videotape, and the VCR. How does looking at these objects in concert with each other change our imagining of the historical trajectory of television in South India? She will argue that the television set’s entanglement with videotapes and the VCR is illustrative of the contentious, close relationship between the commercial cinema industry and television’s growing presence within the lives of Indian media consumers; an entanglement that has so far gone understudied and might offer us new ways to think about how we theorize the pasts and futures of media technologies.
 

About the Speaker
Padma Chirumamilla is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication. Her work examines how media infrastructures shape and are shaped by everyday cultural life and labor in postcolonial South India and the broader Global South. Her dissertation investigates how the television — both the physical object and the broader media entity — were integrated into the daily rhythms of viewers and media workers in small-town and rural regions in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, through venues like the repair shop and technologies likes the videotape and VCR. Through a combination of ethnographic and textually-based methods, Chirumamilla’s research considers how the materiality of media shapes its absorption into the routines and rhythms of everyday life in the Global South. She is also interested in notions of technological futurity, and how the futuristic allure of digital technologies configures everyday encounters with media infrastructures in the Global South. Chirumamilla is a first-generation postsecondary scholar. She received her Ph.D. in Information Studies from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the summer of 2019. She obtained an M.A. in South and Southeast Asian Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from the University of Chicago.

An emerging body of research begins to shed light on various aspects  of college promise programs (including free tuition programs), but too  little is known about the full range of program outcomes, or the ideal  structure and design of programs serving different groups of students in  different sectors of higher education in different communities,  regions, and states.
This research conference, to be held October  19-20, 2017 on the University of Pennsylvania campus, is designed to  stimulate production of a set of papers that collectively address the  following questions:
What are the characteristics of students  who participate in promise programs? How do characteristics of  participating students vary based on program characteristics?
What are the outcomes of promise programs for participating students?
What are the outcomes of promise programs for other stakeholders,  including K-12 schools, colleges and universities, and communities?
How do program outcomes for students and other stakeholders vary based on program characteristics?
