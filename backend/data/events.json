Ongoing variations of these internal states affect global patterns of neural activity, giving rise to apparent variability of neural responses under the same experimental conditions. Uncovering dynamics of internal states from data proved difficult with traditional techniques based on trial-averaged responses of single neurons. In this talk, I will describe our recent work leveraging multi-electrode neural activity recordings and computational models to reveal internal-state dynamics of neural populations during perception and goal-directed behavior. I will show how endogenous fluctuations of ensemble neural activity in the primate visual cortex depend on the global arousal and selective attention. The spatiotemporal structure of these fluctuations accounts for correlated variability across cortical layers and columns. I will then present a broadly applicable, non-parametric framework for discovering neural population dynamics directly from the data without a priori model assumptions. The framework uncovers dynamic computations from large-scale neural recordings with single-neuron, single-spike resolution.","endtime":"12:30 PM","event_id":"","event_index":2,"location":"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building","owner":"Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)","speaker":"Tatiana Engel","starttime":"11:30 AM","summary":"","title":"Discovering dynamic states of neural populations","url":"https:\/\/cni.upenn.edu\/events\/cni-seminar-tatiana-engel"}

Outcome valuation is subjective \u2013 it requires consulting the decision maker\u2019s internal preferences and is sensitive to context. Probability estimation is also subjective \u2013 but requires the decision maker to first extract statistics from the environment before using them to estimate probability. Currently, it is unclear whether the two computations share similar algorithms and neural-algorithmic implementations.I will present our recent work on context-dependent probability estimation, which we identified both similarities and differences in computational mechanisms between valuation and probability estimation. I will also talk about work on modeling probability estimation as Bayesian inference, which focuses on examining how and how well people estimate probability of reward in the presence of prior and likelihood information. Here we found suboptimal performance similar to base-rate neglect, which surprisingly is robust across a wide variety of setups that try to eliminate this behavior. Together, these results suggest many interesting aspects of probability estimation that have yet to be fully understood at the behavioral, computational, and neural algorithmic levels.Bio:\u00a0I obtained my PhD (2008) from New York University working on representations and use of probability information in decision making under risk with Larry Maloney.

While true, this is an impoverished description. Our work explores how circuits in the visual thalamus contribute to sensory processing per se. Although thalamocortical cells make few local connections, they are embedded in two dense inhibitory networks. First, local interneurons supply feedforward inhibition; second, neurons in the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus (a thin sheet of gabaergic cells that cloak the thalamus) provide feedback inhibition. We use anatomical, physiological and computational tools to understand how each inhibitory network operates and we compare results across species to resolve evolutionarily conserved aspects of thalamic structure and function.","endtime":"12:30 PM","event_id":"","event_index":4,"location":"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building","owner":"Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)","speaker":"Judith Hirsch","starttime":"11:30 AM","summary":"","title":"Understanding how inhibitory circuits in the thalamus contribute to vision","url":"https:\/\/cni.upenn.edu\/events\/cni-seminar-judith-hirsch"}

We have developed behavioral tasks in which mice integrate internally-stored contextual information, in the form of short-term memories, with sensory cues to guide navigation choices. We have used unbiased methods to identify regions of the mouse cortex involved in these tasks, leading to a particular focus on posterior parietal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and V1. I will present findings that parietal and retrosplenial areas use mixed representations of sensory and contextual information to generate navigational trajectories toward rewarded goal locations.

Neuronal network connectivity demonstrates sparsity on multiple spatial scales and natural stimuli typically also possess sparse representations in appropriate domains. In this talk, we address the role of sparsity in the efficient encoding of network structure and inputs through nonlinear neuronal network dynamics. We develop a theoretical framework for reconstructing sparse network data by leveraging compressive sensing theory and the linearity of input-output mappings commonly underlying neuronal dynamics. Addressing the theoretical and experimental challenges in measuring structural network connectivity, we reconstruct model neuronal network connections using the evoked dynamics in response to a small ensemble of random stimuli. Using the reconstructed connectivity matrix, we then accurately recover detailed network inputs distinct from the random input ensemble. Analyzing several receptive field models, we investigate how the accuracy of input reconstructions depends on the network architecture, and demonstrate that the center-surround structure common in the early visual system facilitates marked improvements in natural scene processing well beyond the uniformly-random connectivity typical in compressive sensing theory. However, we show that the spatial localization inherent in receptive fields combined with information loss introduced by nonlinear neuronal dynamics may underlie deficiencies in processing specific classes of non-natural stimuli, yielding a novel explanation for the manifestation of certain illusory effects. We expect this talk will provide a new perspective for understanding compressive encoding in sensory systems as well as the structure-function relationship in neuronal networks.","endtime":"12:30 PM","event_id":"","event_index":7,"location":"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building","owner":"Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)","speaker":"Victor Barranca","starttime":"11:30 AM","summary":"","title":"Reconstruction of Sparse Connectivity and Stimuli in Neuronal Networks Using Compressive Sensing of Network Dynamics","url":"https:\/\/cni.upenn.edu\/events\/cni-seminar-victor-barranca"}

For example, distinct neuroanatomical substrates have been proposed for declarative memory versus perceptual learning, short-term versus long-term memory, and familiarity versus recollection. I will present theoretical and empirical work, including connectionist simulations, behavioral studies and fMRI data, that challenges process-based accounts of memory and visual cognition. Instead, I will argue that the ventral visual stream and medial temporal lobe (MTL) can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of representations \u2013 from simple features in V1, through feature-conjunctions in inferior temporal cortex, to complex conjunctions of items and context in MTL. Under this view, the processes that operate upon the representations to produce a behavioral output \u2013 e.g., \u201cpattern completion\u201d to produce recall of a memory \u2013 can occur anywhere along the hierarchy.The studies I will present demonstrate how a single brain region can support more than one cognitive process (visual discrimination and recognition memory); that a cognitive process (recollection) previously thought tied to one brain region (hippocampus) can also unfold elsewhere; and that this \u201cRepresentational-Hierarchical\u201d framework makes accurate predictions for the organization of representations within the ventral visual stream, and for the effects of aging on recognition memory. This suggests that it may be possible to banish the ghosts of process from the neural machinery of memory, and explain the neuroanatomical organization of cognition in terms of representations alone.","endtime":"12:30 PM","event_id":"","event_index":9,"location":"Barchi Library, 140 John Morgan Building","owner":"Computational Neuroscience Initiative (CNI)","speaker":"Rosie Cowell","starttime":"11:30 AM","summary":"","title":"Banishing Ghosts of Process from the Neural Machinery of Human Memory: A Representational Hierarchical Account of Cognition","url":"https:\/\/cni.upenn.edu\/events\/cni-seminar-rosie-cowell"}

Whereas some states have restrictive policies about what types of evidence be turned over to the defense and when, other states have adopted \u201copen-file\u201d discovery policies such that essentially the entire case file be made available to the defense. To some degree, open-file policies have been adopted as a response to reducing wrongful convictions and deterring prosecutor\u2019s withholding of exculpatory evidence. In the context of trials, prosecutors must turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense; to not do so is considered misconduct (i.e., Brady violations). However, in the context of guilty pleas--which account for 95% of convictions--whether, and what forms of, exculpatory evidence need be disclosed is much less clear. In this presentation, Professor Redlich will present her program of research examining prosecutor and defendant plea decision-making under varying discovery policies.","endtime":"01:00 PM","event_id":"","event_index":61,"location":"395 McNeil Building\u00a0\n3718 Locust Walk\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104","owner":"Dapartment of Criminology","speaker":"","starttime":"12:00 PM","summary":"","title":"Criminology Colloquium Series: Allison Redlich","url":"https:\/\/crim.sas.upenn.edu\/events\/criminology-colloquium-series-allison-redlich"}

Drawing upon primary sources from Ottoman, Armenian, British and French archives, as well as from memoirs and personal papers, the first part of the talk examines the efforts of some of Aintab\u2019s most prominent citizens to get the central government to expel the district\u2019s Armenians.

{"date":"September 27, 2019","date_dt":"27-09-2019","description":"Levels of organization and their use in science have received increased philosophical attention of late, including challenges to the well-foundedness or widespread\u00a0usefulness of levels concepts. One kind of response to these challenges has been to advocate a more precise and specific levels concept that is coherent and useful.\u00a0Another kind of response has been to argue that the levels concept should be taken as a heuristic, to embrace its ambiguity and the possibility of exceptions as\u00a0acceptable consequences of its usefulness. In this talk, I suggest that each of these strategies faces its own attendant downsides, and that pursuit of both strategies\u00a0(by different thinkers) compounds the difficulties. That both kinds of approaches are advocated is, I think, illustrative of the problems plaguing the concept of levels\u00a0of organization. I end by suggesting that the invocation of levels may mislead scientific and philosophical investigations more than it informs them, so our use of the\u00a0levels concept should be updated accordingly.","endtime":"","event_id":"","event_index":84,"location":"Cohen 402","owner":"Department of Philosophy","speaker":"","starttime":"3:00pm","summary":"","title":"Colloquium: Angela Potochnik","url":"https:\/\/philosophy.sas.upenn.edu\/events\/colloquium-angela-potochnik"}

At the outbreak of WW II, Simone Weill offered her radical interpretation of 'force' as the true hero of the Iliad. Classicist Kevin Herbert took the Iliad with him to Saipan where it served him well while he served, by his own choice, as a tail gunner in the bombing of Japan. Joseph Heller, besmitten with the Iliad since childhood, used it and Achilles as templates for Catch-22 and its central character Yossarian. And Anthony Swofford in Jarhead talks about reading the Iliad, but doesn't seem to draw any lessons from it applicable to his experiences in Operation Desert Storm.\nHere we will look at ways in which the Iliad is used and misused, and some true problems key passages still pose to interpretation, by bonafide classical scholars (some labeled Homerists) and by others who would use the Iliad in translation as a tool for understanding what war is and does, for training soldiers and officers to fight, and for trying to heal the trauma war causes in human societies.\n","endtime":"6:00pm","event_id":"","event_index":91,"location":"As the ancient Greeks knew and General Douglass MacArthur thought that Plato wrote\u2014and many other, including the Royal War Museum in London, have since believed because of MacArthur's error: \"Only the dead have seen an end to war.\"","owner":"Department of Classical Studies","speaker":"","starttime":"4:30pm","summary":"","title":"COLLOQUIUM: Tom Palaima, The University of Texas at Austin, \"The troubles with Achilles: problems with using the Iliad as a testament to war trauma and an instrument in its treatment\"","url":"https:\/\/www.classics.upenn.edu\/events\/colloquium-tom-palaima-university-texas-austin-troubles-achilles-problems-using-iliad"}

{"date":"EDT September 17","date_dt":"17-09-2019","description":"Title: Nonparametric Causal Effects Based on Incremental Propensity Score Interventions\n\nAbstract:\u00a0Most work in causal inference considers deterministic interventions that set each unit\u2019s treatment to some fixed value. However, under positivity violations these interventions can lead to nonidentification, inefficiency, and effects with little practical relevance. Further, corresponding effects in longitudinal studies are highly sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, resulting in widespread use of unrealistic parametric models. We propose a novel solution to these problems: incremental interventions that shift propensity score values rather than set treatments to fixed values. Incremental interventions have several crucial advantages. First, they avoid positivity assumptions entirely. Second, they require no parametric assumptions and yet still admit a simple characterization of longitudinal effects, independent of the number of timepoints. For example, they allow longitudinal effects to be visualized with a single curve instead of lists of coefficients. After characterizing incremental interventions and giving identifying conditions for corresponding effects, we also develop general efficiency theory, propose efficient nonparametric estimators that can attain fast convergence rates even when incorporating flexible machine learning, and propose a bootstrap-based confidence band and simultaneous test of no treatment effect. Finally, we explore finite-sample performance via simulation, and apply the methods to study time-varying sociological effects of incarceration on entry into marriage.","endtime":" 4:30pm","event_id":"","event_index":201,"location":"701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104","owner":"Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)","speaker":"","starttime":"3:30pm ","summary":"","title":"Biostatistics Seminar Series - Edward Kennedy, PhD","url":"http:\/\/events.med.upenn.edu\/cceb\/#!view\/event\/event_id\/710420"}

{"date":"EDT October 1","date_dt":"01-10-2019","description":"Title: From dependent happenings to causal inference with interference\nAbstract: Sir Ronald Ross developed a Theory of Happenings that distinguished independent from depending happenings. Dependent happenings are those in which the frequency of the happening depends on the number of individuals affected such as in most infectious diseases. Due to dependent happenings, interventions in infectious diseases can have several different kinds of effects. Demonstrating indirect effects of vaccination can have important consequences for public health policy. Causal inference using potential outcomes is an experimental paradigm to define estimands and estimators of causal effects of interventions. In infectious diseases, the potential outcome of an individual can depend on the treatment status of other individuals, called interference in causal inference. Defining causal estimands and estimators under interference is complicated. Here we present causal estimands and estimators of direct, indirect, total and overall effects of interventions under interference, with emphasis on vaccination in infectious diseases. We present these in both the two-stage randomized, one-stage randomized, and observational context.\u00a0 We present examples of estimating these different effects for different vaccines using different approaches. We present recent trends in developing these methods that include using networks to allow for individual interference sets, for structured interference, and randomized experiments in large networks. Demonstrating indirect effects of vaccination can have important consequences for public health policy.","endtime":" 4:30pm","event_id":"","event_index":204,"location":"701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104","owner":"Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)","speaker":"","starttime":"3:30pm ","summary":"","title":"Biostatistics Seminar Series: Elizabeth Halloran, MD, DSc","url":"http:\/\/events.med.upenn.edu\/cceb\/#!view\/event\/event_id\/710422"}

{"date":"EDT October 8","date_dt":"08-10-2019","description":"Title: A two-part model for individualized treatment rule estimation with semi-continuous outcomes\n\nAbstract: Health care costs in the United States have continued to rise despite little meaningful improvement in health outcomes. A significant portion of these health care costs come from hospital spending. To help improve patient outcomes while reducing the cost of care, health care systems have put on a lot of effort into developing innovative interventions\/treatments. Thus, determining target patients deemed likely to benefit from the innovative treatments is a key interest. In other words, we want to identify individualized treatment rules (ITRs) for targeted enrollment of patients. In this paper, we use the health care payments (which is a significant component to health care utilization) as our primary outcome. The problem is challenging such that health care payments often follow a mixture distribution with many patients incurring little to no payments over a given period of time and some patients incurring large costs: i.e. semi-continuous. We develop a general framework for estimation of ITRs based on a two-part modeling, where models are estimated for the zero part of the outcome and the positive part separately. To improve estimation performance in high dimensions, we leverage a scientifically-plausible penalty that encourages the signs of coefficients for each variable to agree between the two models.

Available information in this scenario commonly includes longitudinal measurements from the same subject. Since future information is unknown and may develop dynamically over time, such a predictive problem is challenging. We consider a predictive approach based on modeling the forward intensity function. The forward intensity function approach is appealing for being capable of intrinsically incorporating the future dynamics that affect the stochastic event occurrence. To handle the practical difficulty due to the missing data in the longitudinal measurements, and to accommodate observations at irregularly spaced time points, we propose a smoothed composite likelihood approach for estimating the forward intensity model. Our theoretical analysis establishes the validity of the predictive modeling approach and the smoothed composite likelihood method. Extensive simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the promising performance of the predictive approach. This is a joint work with Lili Zhu.","endtime":" 4:30pm","event_id":"","event_index":207,"location":"701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104","owner":"Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)","speaker":"","starttime":"3:30pm ","summary":"","title":"Biostatistics Seminar Series - Cheng Yong Tang, PhD","url":"http:\/\/events.med.upenn.edu\/cceb\/#!view\/event\/event_id\/710448"}
{"date":"EDT October 29","date_dt":"29-10-2019","description":"Title: Back to the Basics: Residuals and Diagnostics for Generalized Linear Models\n\nAbstract: Ordinal outcomes are common in scientific research and everyday practice, and we often rely on regression models to make inference. A long-standing problem with such regression analyses is the lack of effective diagnostic tools for validating model assumptions. The difficulty arises from the fact that an ordinal variable has discrete values that are labeled with, but not, numerical values. The values merely represent ordered categories. In this paper, we propose a surrogate approach to defining residuals for an ordinal outcome Y. The idea is to define a continuous variable S as a \u201csurrogate\u201d of Y and then obtain residuals based on S. For the general class of cumulative link regression models, we study the residual\u2019s theoretical and graphical properties. We show that the residual has null properties similar to those of the common residuals for continuous outcomes. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the residual has power to detect misspecification with respect to 1) mean structures; 2) link functions; 3) heteroscedasticity; 4) proportionality; and 5) mixed populations. The proposed residual also enables us to develop numeric measures for goodness-of-fit using classical distance notions. Our results suggest that compared to a previously defined residual, our residual can reveal deeper insights into model diagnostics. We stress that this work focuses on residual analysis, rather than hypothesis testing. The latter has limited utility as it only provides a single p-value, whereas our residual can reveal what components of the model are mis specified and advise how to make improvements.\n\n\n  This is a joint work with Dungang Liu, University of Cincinnati Lindner College of Business.","endtime":" 4:30pm","event_id":"","event_index":208,"location":"701 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104","owner":"Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB)","speaker":"","starttime":"3:30pm ","summary":"","title":"Biostatistics Seminar Series - Heping Zhang, PhD","url":"http:\/\/events.med.upenn.edu\/cceb\/#!view\/event\/event_id\/710452"}

The biases from intermittent observation of time-dependent covariates\u00a0will also be considered along with a multistate approach to mitigating this bias through joint modeling.

Using declassified intelligence data and diplomatic documents from South Korea, the US, and former countries of the Eastern Bloc, I examine how and why inter-Korean military competition intensified during the d\u00e9tente period, culminating in the security crisis of 1976. Triggered by the Panmunjom axe murders, the stand-off was the Korean version of the Cuban missile crisis: the two Koreas narrowly but consciously avoided full-scale war; yet the arms race continued and persists to this day.

Despite her remarkable contributions toward modernizing the tradition, she is absent in the scholarship of Korean Buddhism. In this talk, I will draw on the known bits and pieces of information on Ch\u2019\u014fn to make a case that she played a seminal role in the incipient stage of modern Korean Buddhism. Ch\u2019\u014fn drew on a wide network of relationships both inside and outside the court to help establish the first modern institution of Korean Buddhism, build the first modern temple in central Seoul, and open the first modern Buddhist clinic in Korea. This article seeks to restore Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s centrality as a Buddhist modernizer, thereby ultimately bringing balance to a largely monastic-centered and nationalist history and lengthening the lineage of lay female leadership in the transformation of Korean Buddhism in the beginning of the twentieth century.","endtime":"","event_id":"","event_index":244,"location":"","owner":"Korean Studies","speaker":"Hwansoo Kim  \n\n    Associate Professor, Department of Religious Studies  \n\n    Yale University","starttime":"12:00pm","summary":"","title":"Restoring Buddhism to Seoul: Court Lady Ch\u2019\u014fn\u2019s Influence in Modernizing Korean Buddhism","url":"https:\/\/www.sas.upenn.edu\/koreanstudies\/events\/restoring-buddhism-seoul-court-lady-ch%E2%80%99%C5%8Fn%E2%80%99s-influence-modernizing-korean-buddhism"}

To answer this question, this book\u00a0takes a comparative look at the state building process along China, Myanmar, and Thailand's common borderland area. It shows that the variations in state building among these neighboring countries are the result of an interactive process that occurs across national boundaries. Departing from existing approaches that look at such processes from the angle of singular, bounded territorial states, the book argues that a more fruitful method is to examine how state and nation building in one country can influence, and be influenced by, the same processes across borders. It argues that the success or failure of one country's state building is a process that extends beyond domestic factors such as war preparation, political institutions, and geographic and demographic variables. Rather, it shows that we should conceptualize state building as an interactive process heavily influenced by a \"neighborhood effect.\" Furthermore, the book moves beyond the academic boundaries that divide arbitrarily China studies and Southeast Asian studies by providing an analysis that ties the state and nation building processes in China with those of Southeast Asia.\nEnze Han is\u00a0an Associate Professor at the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong.

The workshop will convene at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for the Study of Contemporary China (CSCC) on Saturday, October 26, 2019. CHAIR brings young IR scholars together to share their latest research related to China, build a professional network, and strengthen the academic community that focuses on China and IR topics. CHAIR is also the ideal venue for participants to present revised versions of papers from APSA\u2019s summer 2019 meeting or rough drafts of papers for ISA\u2019s spring 2020 convention. CSCC will reimburse participants up to $500 for accommodation and travel expenses. The bulk of our applications tends to come from the United States and Canada, but we are open to applicants from around the world (those traveling from beyond the US East Coast may be eligible for additional funding).\nWe are looking for approximately ten participants to present works that are part of their dissertations or that they intend to publish. Paper topics span the entire range of the IR sub-field, and abstracts will be chosen based on their level of development, fit with other submissions as part of a cohesive session, and representation of diverse perspectives, methodologies, and institutions. The day-long workshop will consist of four thematically-organized sessions, each comprised of 2-3 presenters and a discussant. Each presenter need only offer a\u00a0brief\u00a0overview of the paper (~5 minutes), to be followed by the discussant\u2019s short, detailed comments on all the papers (~15 minutes). The majority of each session will be devoted to discussion open to all the participants.\u00a0We expect all participants to have read the papers before the workshop, so that workshop discussions on the day can be as fruitful and productive as possible.\nCHAIR offers an opportunity to build a community of young IR scholars who study China, and there will be ample time for socializing throughout the day. In addition to inter-session breaks, a catered lunch will be provided and, at the workshop\u2019s conclusion, we will be pleased to host dinner at a local restaurant for further conversation in a more casual setting. CHAIR thus represents an excellent opportunity for academic enrichment and professional networking. To see past workshop participants and papers, please visit our\u00a0Facebook page. We look forward to receiving your submissions.\nSincerely,\nRachel Hulvey, Clara Lee, and Alina Zheng\n\nAbstract Submission Instructions\nAbstracts are due by\u00a011:59p.m. USEDT, Friday, September 6,2019.\nThere are two components to a submission:\n1.

For much of the 19th century, color photography was thought to be an impossibility. The announcement in February 1891 that the French experimental physicist Gabriel Lippmann had produced a colored image of an electromagnetic spectrum consequently generated widespread publicity. In the photographic press this ranged from incredulous dismissal to slavish triumphalism, which in France stemmed from patriotic traditions of photography and wave optics. Seeking a more balanced historical perspective on Lippmann\u2019s achievement, Mitchell examines its reception in Britain. How did Lippmann succeed in convincing photographic chemists that his method was \u201cphysical\u201d rather than chemical? Why was his spectral image perceived as such a decisive step toward full-color photography? How could the nature of his work be fixed even before it was viewed publicly in London? The answers to these questions open up the interfaces between science and visual art, theory and impression, and nationalism and internationalism at the fin de si\u00e8cle.

To that end, we hope to have one junior author and one senior author at each session.\nWorkshop Format\nThe workshop will meet roughly once each month over the academic year. Any academic or practitioner with an interest in normative business ethics is invited to attend the sessions. Attendees are expected to read the papers in advance and to come with feedback for the paper authors.

{"date":"October 10, 2019","date_dt":"10-10-2019","description":"Professor Daniel LaChance of Emory University will present on \u201cMrs. Miller\u2019s Constitution: Civil Liberties and the Radical Right in Cold War America\u201d\n\n\nAbstract: In the early years of the Cold War, grassroots activists on the far-right end of the political spectrum became convinced that government bureaucracies were quietly ushering in an age of despotism. They grew especially alarmed at the growing power the government was giving to psychiatrists to oversee the psychological wellbeing of Americans. Using the state\u2019s police powers, they feared, liberals would soon declare anti-communists and other conservatives mentally ill and banish them to mental institutions. Two events in the 1950s brought these anxieties to a fever pitch: the involuntary confinement of Vermont anti-communist activist Lucille Miller to a federal psychiatric hospital and federal legislation to fund the construction of a mental hospital in the Alaska territory.\n  In their campaigns to free Miller and stop the construction of what they believed would be an Alaskan gulag, these activists turned to the law. They argued that the Constitution safeguarded a vision of liberty as the absence of unwanted government intrusions into an individual\u2019s life. While these ultraconservative activists were dismissed as crackpots, many of their critics also felt a sense of diminished autonomy in the postwar world. In subsequent decades, they too would grow wary of government paternalism and embrace, for various reasons, a more libertarian understanding of rights. This idea of rights would eclipse an alternative vision of them as a tool for pursuing collective, egalitarian ends. To our growing body of explanations about how communitarian possibilities for civil rights and civil liberties were \u201clost\u201d or \u201ctamed\u201d in the middle of the twentieth century, we might add anxieties about the fragility of the individual mind, which the cultural life of the Cold War drove to unprecedented levels.","endtime":"1:20 PM","event_id":"60767","event_index":313,"location":"Faculty Lounge","owner":"Penn Law School","speaker":"","starttime":"12:00 PM","summary":"","title":"Legal History Workshop: Daniel LaChance, Emory University","url":"https:\/\/www.law.upenn.edu\/newsevents\/calendar.php#event_id\/60767\/view\/event"}

He was\u00a0defeated by\u00a0the\u00a0arguments of a woman, the Virgin Mary.

{"date":"November 5, 2018","date_dt":"05-11-2018","description":"Professor Hirota\u2019s current book project, \u201cThe Business of the Nation: Foreign Contract Labor and the Rise of American Immigration Control,\u201d examines the transnational business of importing Asian, Canadian, European, and Mexican contract laborers to the United States and the evolution of federal alien contract labor law designed to restrict this form of immigration over the course of the long nineteenth century. Since the early nineteenth century, Americans opposed the immigration of poor foreign workers who would degrade the dignity of labor and lower American wage standards. The opposition to immigrant labor became especially strong in the case of contract workers. In 1885, American workers\u2019 antipathy to \u201calien contract labor\u201d resulted in the passage of the federal Foran Act to ban the landing of foreign contract workers and deport those already in the United States back to their countries of origin. This project examines how hostility toward contract labor migration influenced American immigration law and how the alien contract labor law in turn affected immigrant workers.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  The paper traces the intellectual and legal genealogy of alien contract labor law by surveying the antebellum roots of opposition to imported labor in the United States. While labor radicalism in the late nineteenth century played a crucial role in the introduction of the Foran Act, the federal law was built upon earlier discourses on servile labor and the economic impact on Americans of immigration of certain kinds. In particular, the paper identifies the following four issues in antebellum America as the ideological and legal origins of the alien contract labor law: 1) Free Soilism, 2) \u201cpauper labor\u201d discourse, 3) assisted emigration, and 4) coolieism. The analysis in this paper is not intended to provide new evidence or revise historiography on these topics. Instead, the paper aims to demonstrate how the antebellum debates over the four issues collectively, if not exclusively, laid the foundations for the federal alien contract labor law, placing it in the broader framework of immigration politics beyond the labor conflict in the late nineteenth century.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Hidetaka Hirota is a non-tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Japan.

{"date":"November 27, 2017","date_dt":"27-11-2017","description":"Between 1967 and 1979, the United States\u2019 divorce rate doubled. The rapidly rising divorce rate created a widespread crisis among women who had relied on their husbands for economic support and access to social insurance benefits such as Social Security and health insurance. In reponse, a now-forgotten strand of the 1970s feminist movement, which I call \u201cthe feminist divorce reform movement,\u201d emerged and organized itself around securing women\u2019s place in the United States\u2019 marriage-based insurance system. This paper, part of a larger project on this movement, examines divorce\u2019s decreasing political salience as more and more women entered the permanent workforce. In the 1970s, one-third of married American women were in the paid labor force. By 1985 that number had shot up. Even women with young children were now as likely to be found in the workforce as at home: around 50 percent of mothers with children under three and roughly 70 percent of mothers with children over six were in the labor force. In response, feminists who had once focused on shoring up the marriage-based insurance system turned their efforts toward securing women\u2019s place in the employment-based insurance system. In this paper I consider how legislative battles over the Family and Medical Leave Act, universal child care, and welfare reform fit into a longer history of feminist activism dedicated to creating a social insurance system that protected women from the economic vulnerabilities created by their carework obligations.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Suzanne Kahn received her Ph.D. in American History from Columbia University in 2015.

More specifically, the paper highlights the possible impact of the period of papal interdict (c. 1208 \u2013 1214), imposed by Pope Innocent III in response to King John\u2019s intransigence over the appointment of a new archbishop of Canterbury, during this transitional period in criminal procedure. It argues that the interdict, with its suspension of liturgies, might have forced experimentation with alternative means of reaching verdicts in felony cases. The paper also suggests that juries might have been involved in the issuance of ordeal verdicts in the late ordeal period in England, in which case the shift from trial by ordeal to trial by jury may be less a moment of rupture than a transition from one form of trial using juries to another, albeit a trial form more starkly desacralized after 1215. It is the author\u2019s hope that the paper will serve as a starting point for further research, not a decisive answer to the questions it raises, including whether England\u2019s rapid adoption of final jury verdicts may owe something to the tussle between King John and a particularly imperial and imperious pope.\n\n\n  \u00a0\n\n\n  Elizabeth Papp Kamali is an Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, where she teaches Criminal Law, English Legal History, Medieval English Law, and a seminar on Mind and Criminal Responsibility.\u00a0 She is a faculty member of Harvard\u2019s Standing Committee on Medieval Studies.\u00a0 Her research focuses on the medieval English common law and the history of criminal law, with a particular interest in the early criminal trial jury.\u00a0 Her current projects include studies of the role of criminal intent in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century English felony cases, medieval understandings of anger\u2019s operation in felony adjudication, conflict between urban customary law and the English common law in the early fourteenth century, and the influence of Roman law on the early development of the common law.\u00a0 Recent publications include \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Daughter of Hell Fire: Anger\u2019s Role in Medieval English Felony Cases\u201d (Law and History Review, 2017) and \u201cLaw and Equity in a Medieval English Manor Court\u201d (in Texts and Contexts in Legal History: Essays in Honor of Charles Donahue, 2016).","endtime":"1:15 PM","event_id":"55474","event_index":325,"location":"Faculty Lounge","owner":"Penn Law School","speaker":"","starttime":"12:00 PM","summary":"Workshop open to faculty and invited guests","title":"Legal History Consortium Workshop: Elizabeth Kamali","url":"https:\/\/www.law.upenn.edu\/newsevents\/calendar.php#event_id\/55474\/view\/event"}

The physical process(es) driving the shutdown or \u201cquenching\u201d of star formation in these galaxies remains one of the least understood aspects of galaxy formation and evolution. Although today\u2019s spiral and elliptical galaxies exhibit a clear bimodality in their structures, kinematics, and stellar populations, it may be that the quenching and structural transformation do no occur simultaneously. In this talk I will focus on results from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey of massive galaxies at z~0.8. I will show that early quiescent galaxies, observed much closer to their quenching epoch at z~1, retain significant rotational support (~twice as much as local ellipticals). This suggests that the mechanisms responsible for shutting down star formation do not also have to destroy ordered motion in massive galaxies; the increased dispersion support could occur subsequently via hierarchical growth and minor merging. Finally, I will discuss prospects for extending spatially resolved spectroscopic studies of galaxies immediately following quenching with JWST and eventually 30-m class telescopes.","endtime":"","event_id":"","event_index":336,"location":"","owner":"Penn Physics and Astronomy Department","speaker":"","starttime":"","summary":"","title":"","url":"https:\/\/www.physics.upenn.edu\/events\/astronomy-seminar-formation-massive-galaxies-deep-high-redshift-spectroscopy-lega-c-survey"}
{"date":"","date_dt":"","description":"Living matter, such as biological tissue, can be seen as a nonequilibrium hierarchical assembly of assemblies of smaller and smaller active components, where energy is consumed at many scales. The functionality and versatility of such living or \u201cactive-matter\u201d systems render it a promising candidate to study and to synthetically design. While many active-matter systems reside in fluids (solution, blood, ocean, air), so far, studies that include hydrodynamic interactions have focussed on microscopic scales in Stokes flows, where the active particles are <100\u03bcm and the Reynolds number, Re <<1. At those microscopic scales viscosity dominates and inertia can be neglected. However, what happens as swimmers slightly increase in size (say ~0.1mm-100cm) or as they form larger aggregates and swarms? The system then enters the intermediate Reynolds regime where both inertia and viscosity play a role, and where nonlinearities in the fluid are introduced. In this talk, I will present a simple model swimmer used to understand the transition from Stokes to intermediate Reynolds numbers, first for a single swimmer, then for pairwise interactions and finally for collective behavior. We show that, even for a simple model, inertia can induce hydrodynamic interactions that generate novel phase behavior, steady states and transitions.","endtime":"","event_id":"","event_index":337,"location":"","owner":"Penn Physics and Astronomy Department","speaker":"","starttime":"","summary":"","title":"","url":"https:\/\/www.physics.upenn.edu\/events\/condensed-and-living-matter-seminar-touch-non-linearity-mesoscale-swimmers-and-active-matter"}

{"date":"","date_dt":"","description":"Fertilization is one of the fundamental processes of living systems. Here I will address marine external fertilization and comment on recent work on mammals. I will show experiments that substantiate that sea urchin sperms exhibit chemotaxis as they swim towards the ovum. They are guided by flagellum internal [Ca2+] concentration fluctuations triggered by the binding of chemicals from the oocyte surroundings. Based on experiment, I present a family of logical regulatory networks for the [Ca2+] fluctuation signaling-pathway that reproduce previously observed electrophysiological behaviors and provide predictions, which have been confirmed with new experiments. These studies give insight on the operation of drugs that control sperm navigation. In this systems biology approach, global properties of the [Ca2+] discrete regulatory network dynamics such as: stability, redundancy, degeneracy, chaoticity and criticality can be determined. Our models operate near a critical dynamical regime, where robustness and evolvablity coexist. This regime is preserved under a class of strong perturbations. Based on global dynamics considerations, we have implemented a network node-reduction method. The coincidence of this reduced network with our bottom-up step-by-step, continuous differential equation modeling is reassuring. For the case of mammals our research has centered on the understanding of capacitation and acrosomal reaction. The first is a process by means of which roughly one third of the spermatozoa acquire the \u201ccapacity\u201d to fertilize; the second enables the spermatozoa to penetrate the egg\u00b4s surrounding zona pellucida. Overall, our studies might contribute to fertility issues such as the development of male contraception treatments, which is an area of intense research.","endtime":"","event_id":"","event_index":340,"location":"","owner":"Penn Physics and Astronomy Department","speaker":"","starttime":"","summary":"","title":"","url":"https:\/\/www.physics.upenn.edu\/events\/mathematical-biology-seminar-fertilization-regulatory-networks"}

The vast journey of blue moves from Hebrew ritual uses of snail pigments to the chemistry and economics of blue jean dyes.\nAmerican chemist Roald Hoffmann is widely known for using quantum mechanics to help reveal the mechanisms of chemical reactions. He was born Roald Safran in 1937 in a small Polish town that is now part of the Ukraine. Hoffmann's father was a civil engineer familiar with the local infrastructure, which made him of value to the Nazis. For a while the family was allowed to remain in its own home, but was later relocated to a labor camp, where many of the Nazi guards could be bribed. After being paid off, the guards allowed 5-year-old Roald, his mother, two aunts, and an uncle to escape in early 1943. A Ukrainian couple hid them in the attic and storeroom of a nearby schoolhouse where the husband taught. Hoffmann's father remained behind in the camp, where he was tortured and killed by the Nazis in June 1943 for his involvement in a plot to arm camp prisoners.After the war ended, Hoffmann and his mother relocated to New York, where he later won a Westinghouse science scholarship to Columbia University, earning his BA there. He took his doctorate in chemistry from Harvard and in 1965 began teaching chemistry at Cornell, where he is now Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus. Since 2002, Hoffmann has hosted a monthly cabaret called \"Entertaining Science\" at Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village.In 1963 Hoffmann introduced the extended H\u00fcckel method, a molecular orbital theory that allows calculation of the electronic structure of molecules. In 1965, in collaboration with Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward, he introduced the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a method for exploring the electronic structure of transition states and intermediates in organic reactions. Hoffmann and Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions (Woodward had died two years earlier and thus was ineligible).Hoffmann is also a published poet, playwright, and essayist. His poems appear in several collections: The Metamict State (1987), Gaps and Verges (1990), Memory Effects (1999), and Soliton (2002). In addition, he is a philosopher of science who has made significant contributions to our conceptual, historical, and normative understanding of chemistry. Many of his philosophical essays have been collected in Roald Hoffman on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry by Jeffrey Kovac and Michael Weisberg, eds. (2012).","endtime":"6:30pm","event_id":"","event_index":351,"location":"Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street","owner":"Wolf Humanities Center Events","speaker":"","starttime":"5:00pm","summary":"","title":"The Allure of Indigo","url":"http:\/\/wolfhumanities.upenn.edu\/events\/allure-indigo"}

How do their patterns provide protective camouflage in tropical rain forests? How is nanotechnology using the waterproofing properties of butterfly colors to fabricate energy-efficient materials for buildings? In this panel discussion, Penn researchers discuss how their scientific and technological work imitates nature.\nUsing holographic lithography, Shu Yang and her Penn research team recently developed a material that mimics the iridescent and water-resistant qualities of butterfly wings. Applying this innovation, they developed a superhydrophobic coating that can be sprayed onto any surface. The solution contains nanoscopic particles that add a nearly invisible layer of roughness to a surface. Among other things, this highly water resistant coating is now being used on solar panels to keep them drier, cleaner and more efficient.\nIn 2004, Shu Yang was named one of the World's Top 100 Innovators Under 35 by MIT Technology Review. In 2006, she received the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Award from the National Science Foundation.

Trained in anthropology and philosophy, his work explores the diversity of the sciences, especially in their interactions with other cultural formations. He focuses on connections between cosmology, experience, social order, and ritual; changing methods, instruments, and disciplinary arrangements in the sciences, arts, and media; and shifting definitions of the rational and real.\nHis book\u00a0The Romantic Machine,\u00a0which is set in France before the revolution of 1848, examines intersections between romanticism, science, industry, and utopian politics. It won the 2013 History of Science Society's Pfizer Award for Outstanding Book and was named one of the Best Books of 2012 by The New Museum in New York. His forthcoming book, Poe's Machinery: Twisted Visions, Incredible Facts, and the Forging of US Science, shows Edgar Allan Poe's technical obsessions in the light of the efforts of scientists to institute authority over knowledge. Tresch is also working on the study of cosmograms as a tool for comparative cosmology, notably in the Anthropocene and the digital age; as well as a study of contemporary neuroscience in its encounters with contemplative practices.\nTresch has held fellowships at Columbia's Society of Fellows in the Humanities, Northwestern, the University of Chicago, the Max Planck Institute for History of Science, the Huntington Library, and the Cullman Center at the New York Public Library.","endtime":"6:30pm","event_id":"","event_index":356,"location":"Rainey Auditorium, Penn Museum, 3260 South Street","owner":"Wolf Humanities Center Events","speaker":"","starttime":"5:00pm","summary":"","title":"Beautiful Science","url":"http:\/\/wolfhumanities.upenn.edu\/events\/beautiful-science"}

Muralists Betsy Casa\u00f1as and Ernel Martinez join Mural Arts Program founder and director Jane Golden in this conversation on culture, community building, and arts education. Moderated by Penn urban design professor Amy Hillier, the event will feature site-specific mural projects from around the city.Jane Golden, as the driving force behind the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, is a true agent of social change, a Philadelphia phenom. Conceived as an anti-graffiti program in 1984, the Mural Arts Program has under Golden's leadership produced over 3600 landmark works of public art in nearly every neighborhood throughout the city. What do these murals embody? So much\u2014about what transforms places, people, communities, and institutions. Read the program's mission statement: \"We believe art ignites change.\" Live its golden rule: \"When we create art with each other and for each other, the force of life can triumph.\" And celebrate its \"Palette of Core Values.\" Do these things, and you will know why Jane Golden has been honored with so many awards, among them the Philadelphia Award, the Hepburn Medal, the 2012 Governor's Award for Innovation in the Arts, and the Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania Award.Betsy Casa\u00f1as is a studio and public mural artist, a community activist, and an educator who was born and raised in the heart of \"The Badlands\" of North Philadelphia's barrio. She received her BFA from Moore College of Art and Design, and has worked in the Latino community since 1994. Casa\u00f1as has exhibited her work in various solo and group exhibits and has designed over 40 public murals and mosaics nationally and internationally. In 2007 she cofounded The Semilla Arts, a grassroots initiative that uses collaborative art as a means of empowering people and communities in underserved areas. In 2010 she opened \"A Seed of Diamond Gallery,\" a community space where artists of different cultural background gather to tell their stories through spoken word, music, and visual arts.Ernel Martinez was inspired to become a mural artist while a PennDesign student in Jane Golden's class on public art at the University of Pennsylvania, where one of his mentors was Terry Adkins. Martinez received his MFA from Penn in 2004 and has since worked on over 25 murals across Philadelphia, including A Place to Call Home, The Color of Your Voice.Amy Hillier holds joint faculty appointments in Penn's School of Design and School of Social Policy and Practice, where she teaches and studies the impact of the built environment on public health and welfare\u2014in particular, the impact to disadvantaged communities of more limited access to services and resources.

Value with respect to color can mean the relative lightness or darkness of a hue, but can also mean aesthetic merit, political importance, moral acceptability, or material worth. The question of color's values is also fundamentally a question of sensory perception, constructed at the level of the individual synapse as well as the cultural collective. We want to consider the descriptive language of color\u2014how we evoke color with and\/or through value-laden words or actions, how we assign qualities or quantities to different colors, how color is experienced through taste or touch as well as sight.Four distinguished scholars - Richard Doyle, Torkwase Dyson, Nicole Fleetwood, and Mohan Matthen - will explore the values of color from a variety of perspectives. How and why do we classify and assign values (moral, economic, social, epistemic) to particular colors, even 'people of color,' or material gradations, from light to dark? How does color function in a modern economy? What is its role in making subjectivity legible through its performance? How does color function as nonverbal communication that is affectively felt? To what degree is color a 'natural' or physical property and in what ways is it a rhetorical or cultural construction? And, how do institutions assign value to color?\u00a0\nSCHEDULE10:00-10:15am | WelcomeElizabeth Della Zazzera, Graduate Humanities Forum ChairNese Devenot, GHF Mellon Fellow\n10:15am-12:30pm | Panel DiscussionModerators: Jeannie Kenmotsu and Ting Fung Ho, GHF Mellon FellowsCommentators: Louise Daoust and Alan Niles, GHF Mellon Fellows\nRichard Doyle\nBy the Way, Which One's Pink?: On the Minimal Conditions for a Transmission of Philip K.

Called synesthesia, this human perceptual condition in which information between the senses is blended has long fascinated scientists and laypeople alike. Award-winning neuroscientist and New York Times bestselling author David Eagleman presents new findings from his research into the behavioral, neurological, and genetic characteristics of synesthetes.\nThere are an infinite number of boring things to do in science. But we live these short life spans. Why not do the thing that's the coolest thing in the world to do? \u2014David Eagleman, The New Yorker\n\nDavid Eagleman is best known for his work on time perception, synesthesia, and neurolaw. He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at the Baylor College of Medicine, whose goal is to understand how the brain constructs perception, how different brains do so differently, and how this matters for society. He also founded and directs Baylor's Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, which studies how new discoveries in neuroscience should navigate the way we make laws, punish criminals, and develop rehabilitation. And, he founded and is chief scientific officer for BrainCheck, a company that uses interactive testing on portable tablets to measure brain function, which schools are using to rapidly measure concussions at the sidelines.\nIn 2011, Eagleman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and that same year won the Eric Hoffer Book Award Montaigne Medal for his book Wednesday is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia, coauthored with Richard Cytowic. In 2012 he was named Science Educator of the Year by the Society for Neuroscience, and was featured as one of the year's Brightest Idea Guys by Italy's Style Magazine. In 2014, he received the John J. McGovern Award for Excellence in Biomedical Education from the American Medical Writers' Association.\nOne of his latest books, Livewired: How the Brain Rewrites its Own Circuitry, is due in spring 2015 (Doubleday Canada). Also in Fall 2015, Eagleman will host the new PBS science series, \"The Brain with Dr. David Eagleman.\"\nFrom the Eagleman Laboratory website, in his own words:\"Public understanding of science is a passion of mine, and to that end I have written for the New York Times, Discover Magazine, Atlantic, The Week, Slate, Wired, New Scientist, and others. I speak often on National Public Radio and BBC to discuss what's new and important in science. I have founded a prize in mathematics and physics.\"I am fortunate to be a Guggenheim Fellow.

When combined with the fixed, tempered intonation of the piano, just sonorities both maintain their internal timbral stability while creating strong acoustic beating at speeds precise enough that they can be used as rhythmic and temporal structures in the piece. This allows for a reimagining of consonance and dissonance as a fluid spectrum of speeds and intensities of acoustic beating. These concepts will be explored with reference to several recent works written for violinist Josh Modney and cellist Mariel Roberts, including if and only if (2019), gretchen am spinnrade (2016), being-time (2013-15), and \"the children of fire come looking for fire\" (2012).\n\nPlease join us the following evening on Wednesday, September 18 at University Lutheran to see the debut program\u00a0If And Only If\u00a0featuring Eric Wubbels with Josh Modney and Mariel Roberts, presented by Bowerbird.\n\nAbout Eric Wubbels\n\nEric Wubbels (b.1980) is a composer and pianist, and a Co-Director of the Wet Ink Ensemble.\n\nHis music has been performed throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, and the U.S., by groups such as Wet Ink Ensemble, Mivos Quartet, yarn|wire, Splinter Reeds, Kupka's Piano (AUS), SCENATET (DK), Hong Kong New Music Ensemble, and featured on festivals including Huddersfield Festival, Chicago Symphony MusicNOW, LA Phil Green Umbrella Series, New York Philharmonic CONTACT, MATA Festival, and Zurich Tage fu\u0308r Neue Musik.\n\nWubbels has been awarded grants and fellowships from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, NYFA, NYSCA, Chamber Music America, ISSUE Project Room, MATA Festival, Barlow Endowment, Jerome Foundation, and Yvar Mikhashoff Trust, and residencies at the MacDowell Colony (2011, 2016), Copland House, L'Abri (Geneva),\u00a0 Djerassi Resident Artists Program, and Civitella Ranieri Center (Italy).\n\nAs a performer, he has given U.S. and world premieres of works by major figures such as Peter Ablinger, Richard Barrett,\u00a0 Beat Furrer, George Lewis, and Mathias Spahlinger, as well as vital young artists such as Rick Burkhardt, Francesco Filidei, Erin Gee, Bryn Harrison, Clara Iannotta, Darius Jones, Cat Lamb, Ingrid Laubrock, Charmaine Lee, Alex Mincek, Sam Pluta, Katharina Rosenberger, and Kate Soper.\n\nHe has recorded for Carrier Records, hatART, Intakt, New Focus, Spektral (Vienna),\u00a0 quiet design, and Albany Records, among others, and has held teaching positions at Amherst College and Oberlin Conservatory.","endtime":"","event_id":"","event_index":372,"location":"","owner":"Department of Music","speaker":"","starttime":"5:15pm","summary":"","title":"Penn Colloquium Series: Eric Wubbels","url":"https:\/\/www.sas.upenn.edu\/music\/events\/penn-colloquium-series-eric-wubbels"}

Goldschmitt, Assistant Professor of Music, Wellesley College\nEthnomusicologist and popular music scholar of Brazil, Latin America, and Luso-Africa; Jazz and the African Diaspora; Audiovisual Media; global music industry\n\nFor at least 20 years, scholars, critics, and music fans have taken note of the affective power of Caetano Veloso's recording of \"Cucurrucuc\u00faPaloma\" in international queer cinema. The creative choices that have gone into featuring the song in key moments of emotional gravitas on stage and screen latch onto fragments of the song\u2019s extended meaning in audiovisual media, whether it be in homage or as a sendup of masculinity. Prior to Veloso\u2019s performance of it, \u201cCucurrucuc\u00fa Paloma\u201d had an extended life incom\u00e9dias rancheras, a style of musical film from the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of Mexican Cinema, where it was often performed by women. This presentation traces the meanings and affective content of the song\u2019s prominence in queer screen media and performance, focusing in particular onMoonlight(2016) and the performed repertoire of Fado Bicha, an influential queer fado duo from Lisbon. It argues that when the song appears, the artists in question are latching onto fragments of the song\u2019s extended meaning in audiovisual media, especially as regards Veloso\u2019s vocal timbre and changes in the song\u2019s arrangement. Contextualizing this musical choice allows us further insight into how a seemingly obscure musical cue can deepen the meaning of performance for knowledgeable publics.\n\nAbout\u00a0K.E.

{"date":"19 Sep 2019 - 5:15pm to 7:30pm","date_dt":"19-09-2019","description":"RSVP via Eventbrite.\nAbout the Talk\nSpies have made a remarkable international comeback in popular film and TV since the early 2010s. Many of the recent TV series and feature films that revolve around spying and surveillance also draw on the Cold War for historical parallels, antecedents, or representational elements to convey a decidedly contemporary sense of ambiguity, allegory, and dystopia that is associated with the global crisis of neo-liberal markets, the erosion of trust in democratic institutions, and the emergence of autocratic leaders worldwide.\nImre probes this association further and asks why and how the memory of the Cold War is resurrected through its favored genre to lend a representative platform to current, globally shared structures of feeling. On the one hand, the implied historical parallels yield a contemporary reevaluation of the Cold War as much more complex and more thoroughly networked among national and other agents than the triumphant Western narrative of two warring empires has long suggested. On the other hand, the comparison between Cold War and contemporary manifestations of spies and spying guide us to understand significant recent transformations in the nature, effects, and experience of surveillance. This transformation involves the global political and affective impact of populism and authoritarianism; stark economic inequality; widespread digital state and corporate surveillance; a conservative backlash against women, minorities, and immigrants; the erosion of democratic institutions; the appearance of fake news delivered by algorithms; and Russia\u2019s return to the international stage as powerful state with imperial ambitions, headed by a former KGB agent.\nEqually important, the comparison between Cold War and contemporary spies highlights a radical transformation of the technological and media networks themselves from nation-based broadcast networks to streaming platforms that are themselves active facilitators of a more widespread, insidious, and inescapable sense of surveillance.

As energy analysts note, the frenetic pace and vast scale of the fracking boom constitutes an \u201cenergy revolution\u201d that is transforming geopolitics and the world economy. Yet the \u201cbig picture\u201d overlooks how personal fracking is. The U.S. is the only country in the world where private property rights extend to all subsurface minerals; the fracking boom depends on the millions of people residing over shale deposits privately agreeing to lease their land\u2019s subsurface mineral rights to petroleum companies. This means that this momentous and far-reaching decision about the planet\u2014to frack or not to frack\u2014is largely a series of individual choices rather than the result of collective deliberation. Many of the spillover effects of fracking are felt close to home: one\u2019s decision to lease may impact neighbors\u2019 air, water, or property. While resource dilemmas are usually experienced in the abstract (e.g., lab simulations, or considering future generations), shale communities must confront the conflict between self-interest and the commonwealth at the fencepost, the general store, and town halls. Based on ethnographic research in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, Jerolmack will discuss how, on the one hand, support for land leasing and fracking cannot be reduced to self-interest and how, on the other hand, the legally protected freedom to exploit one\u2019s mineral rights had the ironic effect of eroding the freedom of others--their right to be left alone, and their sovereignty over their estate. These findings offer lessons for overcoming the greatest collective action problem of all: climate change.\nAbout the Speaker\nColin Jerolmack is an associate professor of Sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU, where he is also the chair of the Environmental Studies Department. He received his Ph.D. in sociology from the City University of New York in 2009; before arriving at NYU, he was a Robert Wood Johnson Scholar in Health Policy at Harvard. Jerolmack's first book, The Global Pigeon (University of Chicago Press), is\u00a0a comparative ethnography of how relations with animals shape our experience of urban life. He is currently completing his next book, Up to Heaven and Down to Hell: Fracking, Freedom, and Community in an American Town (Princeton University Press), on which today's talk is based.

Preoccupations over the nation-state, sovereignty, and national cultural identity have haunted successive paradigms: from early development communication to media imperialism scholars who attacked Western domination to globalization theorists who celebrated or criticized the crumbling of national boundaries. Digitization has brought a host of new challenges that have made sovereignty a fraught and complex issue in the age of social media platforms, cloud computing, drone technology, and mobile devices. How should we reconceive sovereignty in this context? Who or what is sovereign today? How has the exercise of sovereignty changed? And what is it to be subject to these new practices of sovereignty?

{"date":"17 Oct 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm","date_dt":"17-10-2019","description":"About the Book\nBrand warfare is real.\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing details the Colombian government\u2019s efforts to transform Marxist guerrilla fighters in the FARC into consumer citizens. Alexander L. Fattal shows how the market has become one of the principal grounds on which counterinsurgency warfare is waged and postconflict futures are imagined in Colombia. This layered case study illuminates a larger phenomenon: the convergence of marketing and militarism in the twenty-first century. Taking a global view of information warfare,\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0combines archival research and\u00a0extensive fieldwork not just with the Colombian Ministry of Defense and former rebel communities, but also with political exiles in Sweden and peace negotiators in Havana. Throughout, Fattal deftly intertwines insights into the modern surveillance state, peace and conflict studies, and humanitarian interventions, on one hand, with critical engagements with marketing, consumer culture, and late capitalism on the other. The result is a powerful analysis of the intersection of conflict and consumerism in a world where governance is increasingly structured by brand ideology and wars sold as humanitarian interventions.\n\u00a0\nFull of rich, unforgettable ethnographic stories,\u00a0Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a stunning and troubling analysis of the mediation of global conflict.\n\nNew Yorker\n\n\"A sobering book on how armies burnish their brands. . . a detailed, eye-opening investigation.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nReVista\n\n\"Guerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a fascinating book that illustrates how the government\u2019s turn to marketing blurred the boundaries between war and peace by penetrating deep into the emotional space of insurgents and their families. It is a well-written account that intersperses analytic chapters with the author\u2019s riveting interviews with FARC insurgents, which offer a view into how the rebels understand what has happened to themand sidesteps PAHD propaganda. The book should be read by anyone trying to understand contemporary Colombian society.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\n\n\u201cGuerrilla Marketing\u00a0is a fascinating examination of how commercial-style branding has been deployed by both rebels and the state in Colombia's civil war. Fattal deserves high praise for his extraordinary research, carried out over many years in the edgy and borderless terrain of the war's periphery. His insights are lucid and the stories he tells are haunting. This book is a must-read for scholars of modern conflict, journalists, and diplomats.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAbout the Speaker\nAlexander L.

This dystopian narrative has come to dominate political agendas across the globe. To save democracy \u2014 a number of voices argue \u2014 radical measures are needed. In this talk, Johan Farkas critically examines post-truth discourses, honing in on both the contemporary threats posed by disguised propaganda on social media and the risks of advancing undemocratic solutions to solve them.\nThe first part of the talk dives into the rise and proliferation of disguised propaganda on social media, drawing on empirical cases such as the Internet Research Agency in Russia and fake Muslim Facebook pages in Denmark. While disguised propaganda is not a new phenomenon in itself, the technological architecture of digital platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, enables new forms of manipulation, tactically exploiting interfaces, algorithmic proliferation, and content moderation policies. This poses novel challenges for democracy.\nDisguised propaganda in digital media have caused scholars, journalists, and politicians to talk about a post-truth crisis in dire need of fixing. Indeed, for many, truth must be restored at all costs, as democracy is founded on evidence-based decision-making. The second part of the talk critically engages with these post-truth discourses and the solutions they contain. Engaging with critical political philosophy, Farkas highlights how these \"democratic imaginaries\" neglect how democracy has never been about truth, evidence and rationality alone. It is equally about the voice of the democratic people. By neglecting this cornerstone of the democratic tradition, post-truth discourses reproduce and strengthen a risky vision of democracy \u2014 one in which consensus and rationality dominate over civic voices and popular dispute. By doing so, contemporary post-truth discourses \u2014 and the solutions they contain \u2014 might end up deepening existing democratic problems.\nThe talk is based on Farkas\u2019 new book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood, written with Jannick Schou and published by Routledge.\nAbout the Speaker\nJohan Farkas is a Ph.D. Fellow in Media and Communication Studies at Malm\u00f6 University in Sweden. His research engages with the intersection of digital media platforms, disinformation, politics, journalism, and democracy. Farkas has published on these topics in international journals such as New Media & Society, Social Media + Society, and Critical Discourse Studies. In September 2019, his debut book, Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood (with Jannick Schou) was published by Routledge. The book presents a detailed analysis of contemporary discourses of fake news and post-truth, offering both a trenchant critique and call for more inclusive forms of democracy. Farkas is currently Chair of the Young Scholars Network of the European Communication Research and Education Association (YECREA).

The course, The Ethics of Forgetting, was taught by Jessa Lingel (Annenberg School for Communication) and Annette Markam (Aarhus University).\nDigital information is continually being created and circulated, but it is also forgotten, deleted and otherwise lost. Whether from the perspective of journalists, activists, artists or academics, how do we deal with the deletion or loss of media? Where is information archived and what politics guide its organization, curation and erasure? Where do our media live and die? This course began with theories of institutional and individual archiving. It then moved to concepts of remediation and machine learning \u00a0to complicate how information travels, data is stored and archives are 'retrieved'. Finally, using case studies of arts-based digital archiving projects, the course focused on the politics of forgetting media.","endtime":"1:30pm","event_id":"","event_index":395,"location":"Location:\u00a0Annenberg School, Room 500","owner":"Annenberg School of Communication","speaker":"","starttime":"12:00pm","summary":"","title":"Center for Media at Risk: SummerCulture Colloquium","url":"https:\/\/www.asc.upenn.edu\/news-events\/events\/center-media-risk-summerculture-colloquium-0"}
{"date":"07 Nov 2019 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm","date_dt":"07-11-2019","description":"About the Talk\nThis presentation proposes that a key but often overlooked dimension of media infrastructure are those relationalities that remain incommunicado by design. If infrastructure conditions how information, people, and things circulate, then what might the practices of concealment tell us about the political stakes of circulation, and about the nature of our infrastructural surround? What kinds of visual forms emerge in global media events in which concealment is crucial part, sometimes even the condition of possibility for targetable people and equipment to stay on air. This colloquium examines these contradictions in the context of Lebanon, where infrastructural disrepair and breakdown parallel political impasses and fragmentation. It takes the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year as its case study. Based on fieldwork and visual analysis, El-Hibri examines how concealment structures phenomena ranging from live satellite news broadcasts, drone-cam footage, signal jamming and hacking, and online guerilla video from the 2006 Israel-Hizbullah war and subsequent protests in Beirut later that year. He shows how televisual liveness in this event \u2014 that new-again promise to see things faraway as they happen \u2014 demonstrates how the geopolitics of simultaneity has transformed in the contemporary moment.\nAbout the Speaker\nHatim El-Hibri is a\u00a0Faculty Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication and an\u00a0Assistant Professor of Film and Media at George Mason University. He earned his Ph.D in Media, Culture, and Communication from New York University, and previously was a member of the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut. His research and teaching interests are global and Arab media and communication, visual culture studies, media infrastructure, and urban studies. He is currently finalizing his first book titled\u00a0Visions of Beirut: The Urban Life of Media Infrastructure, which examines the history of how images and imaging processes \u2014 from colonial mapping to corporate film to live satellite broadcasts \u2014 have been mobilized in attempts to manage and contest the spaces and sociality of the city.

In his book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea, Greg Burris argues that it is precisely through film and media that hope can occasionally emerge amidst hopelessness, emancipation amidst oppression, freedom amidst apartheid. The author employs the work of Edward W. Said, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, and Cedric J. Robinson in order to locate Palestinian utopia in the heart of the Zionist present. He analyzes the films of prominent directors Annemarie Jacir (Salt of This Sea,\u00a0When I Saw You) and Hany Abu-Assad (Paradise Now) to investigate the emergence and formation of Palestinian identity. Looking at Mais Darwazah\u2019s documentary\u00a0My Love Awaits Me by the Sea, Burris considers the counterhistories that make up the Palestinian experience\u2014stories and memories that have otherwise been obscured or denied. He also examines Palestinian (in)visibility in the global media landscape, and how issues of Black-Palestinian transnational solidarity are illustrated through social media, staged news spectacles, and hip hop music.\u00a0\n\"A deeply felt, brilliantly conceived, meticulously crafted book,\u00a0The Palestinian Idea\u00a0breaks new ground in how we understand vision, space, and identity. Greg Burris's work is an important contribution to Arab and global media studies.\" \u2014Marwan M. Kraidy, Anthony Shadid Chair in Global Media, Politics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania and author of\u00a0The Naked Blogger of Cairo: Creative Insurgency in the Arab World\u00a0\n\u00a0\"Greg Burris has written the book so many people have been waiting for\u2014and he's done it in sharp and readable prose. Situating Palestine in relation to various global revolutionary movements and animating Palestine's own revolutionary identity, Burris has managed the rare feat of producing scholarship that is both timeless and topical. By so thoroughly and imaginatively exploring the idea of Palestine, he illuminates exactly how real Palestine is.\" \u2014Steven Salaita, author of\u00a0Israel's Dead Soul\nAbout the Speaker\nGreg Burris is a film and cultural theorist whose work focuses on race, media, and emancipatory politics. He is an Assistant Professor of Media Studies at the American University of Beirut, and\u00a0his writings have appeared in such publications as\u00a0CineAction,\u00a0Cinema Journal,\u00a0The Electronic Intifada,\u00a0Film Quarterly,\u00a0The Guardian,\u00a0Jadaliyya,\u00a0Middle Eastern Studies,\u00a0Quarterly Review of Film and Video, and the anthologies\u00a0Futures of Black Radicalism\u00a0and\u00a0Global Raciality: Empire, PostColoniality, and Decoloniality.\u00a0The Palestinian Idea: Film, Media, and the Radical Imagination\u00a0is his first book.\nThis talk is co-sponsored by the Middle East Center at the University of Pennsylvania and Slought.\nLunch begins at 11:45.\u00a0Space is limited, RSVP to\u00a0marina.krikorian@asc.upenn.edu.","endtime":"1:00pm","event_id":"","event_index":397,"location":"Location:\u00a0Slought, 4017 Walnut Street","owner":"Annenberg School of Communication","speaker":"","starttime":"12:00pm","summary":"","title":"CARGC Book Talk: Greg Burris, American University of Beirut","url":"https:\/\/www.asc.upenn.edu\/news-events\/events\/cargc-book-talk-greg-burris"}

Through a consideration of the television set\u2019s intertwining with devices ranging from VCRs to set-top boxes and optical-fiber cables, Chirumamilla exposes new veins of analysis through which we might understand both the inter-media history within which television in South India is embedded and the kinds of mediated futures that television\u2019s material transformations portend.\n\u00a0\nFollowing an overview of her larger project, which utilizes both ethnographic research and close textual analysis of newspapers, enthusiast magazines, and policy documents, Chirumamilla will turn her focus to the objects of the television set, the videotape, and the VCR. How does looking at these objects in concert with each other change our imagining of the historical trajectory of television in South India? She will argue that the television set\u2019s entanglement with videotapes and the VCR is illustrative of the contentious, close relationship between the commercial cinema industry and television\u2019s growing presence within the lives of Indian media consumers; an entanglement that has so far gone understudied and might offer us new ways to think about how we theorize the pasts and futures of media technologies.\n\u00a0\n\nAbout the Speaker\nPadma Chirumamilla\u00a0is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Global Communication. Her work examines how media infrastructures shape and are shaped by everyday cultural life and labor in postcolonial South India and the broader Global South. Her dissertation investigates how the television \u2014 both the physical object and the broader media entity \u2014 were integrated into the daily rhythms of viewers and media workers in small-town and rural regions in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, through venues like the repair shop and technologies likes the videotape and VCR. Through a combination of ethnographic and textually-based methods, Chirumamilla\u2019s research considers how the materiality of media shapes its absorption into the routines and rhythms of everyday life in the Global South. She is also interested in notions of technological futurity, and how the futuristic allure of digital technologies configures everyday encounters with media infrastructures in the Global South. Chirumamilla is a first-generation postsecondary scholar. She received her Ph.D. in Information Studies from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the summer of 2019. She obtained an M.A. in South and Southeast Asian Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from the University of Chicago.\u00a0\nLunch begins at 11:45.\u00a0Space is limited, RSVP to\u00a0marina.krikorian@asc.upenn.edu.","endtime":"1:00pm","event_id":"","event_index":398,"location":"Location:\u00a03901 Walnut Street, 6th Floor","owner":"Annenberg School of Communication","speaker":"","starttime":"12:00pm","summary":"","title":"CARGC Colloquium: Padma Chirumamilla, Annenberg School","url":"https:\/\/www.asc.upenn.edu\/news-events\/events\/cargc-colloquium-padma-chirumamilla"}

Science-on-Tap-Nat-Mechanics.jpg Women have contributed to science and technology throughout history. But it often takes specialized skills and new ways of seeing to find the scientific work done by women. Sometimes women were given code names when research was published, a 17th-century strategy to protect their modesty. Sometimes tedious lab work was celebrated as \u201cheroic\u201d when done by men and dismissed as \u201cdrudgery\u201d when done by women. Or scientific organizations might divvy up the labor of science, assigning some tasks to women and other tasks to men, and then not talk about the women\u2019s roles\u2014as in the story Hidden Figures. We can recover the history of women in science, and this talk is about why we must do it now. Science History Institute research fellow Roger Turner studies the uses of science in managing the environment and\u2014much to his surprise\u2014recently helped make a video game about scientific instruments. Since earning his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania, he has taught at Penn, Dickinson College, and the Rochester Institute of Technology.

The lecture series is free and open to the public and takes place in Center City at the Suzanne Roberts Theatre.\u00a0\nRegister Here\nRussian interference, from the Ukraine to the U.S., has forced citizens in the West to face the problems of election hacking, state-sponsored disinformation campaigns, influence operations by foreign security services, and frozen conflicts. Citizens of the frontline states between Russia and the European Union have long been familiar with this type of hybrid war. In his talk, Mitchell Orenstein contends that these \"lands in between\" hold powerful lessons for Western countries. Increasingly, the political pathologies of these small states in Europe are Western problems, too.\nIf you have any questions about the event, please e-mail Amber Grier at events@sas.upenn.edu.\u00a0\n\nSince 2005, expert faculty from the University of Pennsylvania have shed a light on their research at the\u00a0Penn Lightbulb Cafe.

{"date":"","date_dt":"","description":"We have great certainty on how gravity works around our Solar System, but on large scales we still have a considerable lack of understanding about the constituents of our universe. Furthermore, observational tensions are starting to arise as we enter the era of precision cosmology. In this talk, I will mention how we can learn more about cosmology with future gravitational wave data. In particular, I will focus on the use of standard sirens for testing cosmology beyond the \u039bCDM model. I will show how new physics can change the way gravitational waves propagate, and discuss forecasts for binary neutron star mergers with Advanced LIGO. I will show that new physics can bias constraints on the current Hubble rate H0 from standard sirens, and thus it is crucial that we search for these new effects in order to make robust prediction on sensitive cosmological parameters. Finally, I will discuss the role that Lunar Laser Ranging and Binary Pulsar data play on the outlook of standard sirens.","endtime":"","event_id":"","event_index":508,"location":"","owner":"Penn Physics and Astronomy Department","speaker":"","starttime":"","summary":"","title":"","url":"https:\/\/www.physics.upenn.edu\/events\/astronomy-seminar-cosmology-multi-messenger-era"}

Now that the audience is assembled\u202f(Duke, 2018) is a prose poem that describes a fictional musical performance during which an unnamed musician improvises the construction of a series of invented instruments before an audience that is alternately contemplative, participatory, disputatious, and asleep. Both a work of literature and a study of music,\u202fNow that the audience is assembled\u202fexplores the categories of improvised music, solo performance, text scores, instrument building, aesthetic deskilling and reskilling, and the odd fate of the composer in experimental music. Grubbs\u2019s forthcoming The Voice in the Headphones (Duke, 2020) centers on the culture of the recording studio, presenting in intricate, prismatic detail one marathon day in a recording studio over the course of which an unnamed musician struggles to complete a film soundtrack. The Voice in the Headphones arrives at a moment in which the commercial recording studio shades into oblivion and is replaced by digital work environments; it draws upon Grubbs\u2019s own history of several decades as a recording artist, and its location could be described as every studio in which he has set foot. The experience of working in the recording studio is in large part the experience of the language that surrounds and infuses the world of the studio\u2014and that language is the material of this poem.\n\nAbout David Grubbs\n\nDavid Grubbs is Professor of Music at Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center, CUNY.\u00a0 At Brooklyn College he also teaches in the MFA programs in Performance and Interactive Media Arts (PIMA) and Creative Writing.\u00a0 He is the author of Now that the audience is assembled and Records Ruin the Landscape: John Cage, the Sixties, and Sound Recording\u00a0(both Duke University Press)and, with Anthony McCall, Simultaneous Soloists (Pioneer Works Press).\u00a0 In the spring of 2020, Duke University Press will publish The Voice in the Headphones, Grubbs\u2019s second experiment in music writing in the form of a book-length poem.\n\nGrubbs has released fourteen solo albums and appeared on more than 190 releases; his most recent solo recording is Creep Mission (Blue Chopsticks, 2017). In 2000, his The Spectrum Between\u00a0(Drag City) was named \u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d in the London Sunday Times.\u00a0 He is known for his ongoing cross-disciplinary collaborations with poet Susan Howe and visual artists Anthony McCall and Angela Bulloch, and his work has been presented at, among other venues, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, MoMA, the Tate Modern, and the Centre Pompidou.\u00a0 Grubbs was a member of the groups Gastr del Sol, Bastro, and Squirrel Bait, and has performed with Tony Conrad, Pauline Oliveros, the Red Krayola, Will Oldham, Loren Connors, and many others.\u00a0 He is a grant recipient from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, a contributing editor in music for BOMB Magazine, a member of the Blank Forms board of directors, and directorof the Blue Chopsticks record label.","endtime":"","event_id":"","event_index":509,"location":"","owner":"Department of Music","speaker":"","starttime":"5:15pm","summary":"","title":"Penn Colloquium Series: David Grubbs","url":"https:\/\/www.sas.upenn.edu\/music\/events\/penn-colloquium-series-david-grubbs"}

As we think about the possibilities for digital campuses, corporations and communities in the future, it is important to keep in mind the limits of technology in solving social problems. Despite the optimistic promises of digital evangelists, it has become clear that most large-scale software systems exacerbate existing social inequality.\u00a0\nIn this talk, author and professor Meredith Broussard looks at the inner workings and outer limits of technology, and explains why we should never assume that computers always get things right. Making a case against \u201ctechnochauvinism\u201d \u2014 the belief that technology is always the solution \u2014 Broussard looks at why self-driving cars don\u2019t really work and why social problems persist in every digital Utopia. If we understand the limits of what we *can* do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we *should* do with it to make the world better for everyone.\nAbout the Speaker\nMeredith Broussard is an associate professor at the Arthur L.\u00a0Carter Journalism Institute of New York University and the author of\u00a0Artificial\u00a0Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World.\u00a0Her research\u00a0focuses on artificial\u00a0intelligence in investigative reporting, with a\u00a0particular interest in using data analysis for social good.
